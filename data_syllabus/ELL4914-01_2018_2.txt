Welcome! This course presents a study of contemporary Anglophone literature and films that imagine or document globalization, a phenomenon that is characteristic of present-day society. You Tube, Comcast, Facebook, Skype, iTunes, PayPal, Citibank ATMs: with a touch of a few keys, any of us can now see, hear and spend into almost every place in the world. Yet despite the seeming simplicity of such easy access to global culture and capital, the economic, political, social and cultural processes that make it possible are complex, contradictory webs that may at once level differences, accentuate inequalities and open unexpected possibilities. What, we will ask, is globalization? How has globalization changed and shaped our experience? What are the possibilities and limits of the multicultural or cosmopolitan paradigms? What are the driving forces and outcomes of the current globalization process? What does it mean to think globally in the twenty-first century? Thinking through these question, we will explore some of the complexities of globalization and analyze how the course texts depict them.

*Class schedules are tentative and subject to change based on student enrollments and instructor availability. A more detailed syllabus stating course policies and procedures will be provided to students on the first day of class.
