My "World History Group I: European Encounters" courses all focus on the central historical question “How did the West become the West?” or, more specifically,“how and when did Europe become Europe?” To address that question, in these courses we look at a history of European encounters with the “non-Western” world from 1300 to the present day. This semester, the course will focus solely on European encounters with Sub-Saharan Africa. We will read and discuss primary source documents such as maps, paintings, travel narratives, diaries, cartoons, advertisements, comic books, and films.

The course is taught in English, and all materials are in English. I also expect that when you are sitting in my classroom (even before class or discussion has started) that you are speaking English. For me, English is a way for people from multiple ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds to communicate in a shared space without social distinction. Private conversations in a language other than English unintentionally create barriers  between students.
