Public Economics (also called Public Finance) studies various issues related to government activities. Governments collect taxes (revenue or taxation side) and spend them on a variety of areas in the economy (expenditure side). In this course, we will first discuss important issues in the expenditure side such as public goods and governmentsâ€™ intervention on markets with externalities. Then, we will turn to the taxation side to address the effects of various taxes and social insurance programs and the optimal design of those policies. We will also analyze other important topics like government debts and pension system, if time permits.
