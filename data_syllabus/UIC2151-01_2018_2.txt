This course is an introductory class, primarily aiming at understanding and practicing research design. We ask you to learn some background knowledge and do some textbook readings, but these are not fundamental. Rather, we try to let our course promptly beneficial for students at Underwood International College in general and as practical as possible. For instance, you would take literature and history classes at UIC, and you may encounter quite a number of writing assignments. This class can help you learn how to meet rules and requirements of your term papers proper to academic writing, which will also help you achieve satisfactory results. We ask you to submit four individual assignments in order to practice a step-by-step training of research design: the first two are rather simple writings for critical thinking and proper citations; the latter two are longer writings, mid-term and final paper. In addition, the class will give you an opportunity to experience collaborations for conveying a group research project from scratch. Group discussions will be carried out during earlier weeks in class, and each group will provide group presentation at the latter half of the course. We also cover introductory knowledge of quantitative and qualitative methods, but we will not dive into the theories and practices of them in detail. The ultimate focus of this class remains at providing beginnersâ€™ guide to critical thinking and academic reading/writing. Students specifically interested in practicing more advanced level of quantitative methods are recommended to search for other RDQM classes.
