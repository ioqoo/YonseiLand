In many ways the birth of the modern world can be traced back to the British 
islands, whose extraordinary historical impact has been so strikingly out of 
proportion to their size geographically. We shall examine the historical 
evolution of the British Isles in the Early Modern Era (c. 1500 â€“ c. 1800).  
This was the key period in shaping both the British Isles themselves and their 
connections with the world at large. We shall pay special attention to the 
relationships between English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh peoples and 
governments. A central theme will be tracing the emergence and refashioning of 
identities in the diverse territories of the British Isles across this seminal 
historical period in the emergence of the British state and empire.
Students who complete this course successfully should be able to describe the 
major trends in the history of the British Isles, including the interaction 
between England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, the development of local and 
national institutions of government, the evolution of language and literature, 
and the course of relations between the different territories and populations 
of the British Isles and the broader world.
Students will develop their research, writing, and oral presentation skills 
over the semester.  They will become familiar with the primary sources most 
commonly used by historians of the early modern British Isles, learn to 
distinguish them from secondary sources, and develop their ability to analyze 
both types of sources in constructing persuasive historical arguments.
