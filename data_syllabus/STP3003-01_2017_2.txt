These technologies (AI, the digital genome, CRIPR, GMO,Robots,..etc.  ) are now transitioning to a new phase, however, becoming more widely used or incorporated in comsumer goods; these technologyies are bound to gain more ground in coming years. The emergin technologies of the future will redefine our understanding of biology, the material world and manufactureing. The implications will further extend into geopolitics and global balances of power.
