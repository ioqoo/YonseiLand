Masculinities, Modernity, and Men:
From Samurai Warriors and Salarymen of Japan to Kkotminam and Chosiknam of 
South Korea, the archetype of masculinity have changed over time.  This course 
examines public discourses and media projections of masculinity, primarily in 
Japan and South Korea.  Focusing on shifting moments in history, we will 
explore how gendered social order comes into play and governs the way in which 
men perceive themselves or negotiate with projected images.  Some of the 
primary social sites that we will pay attention to are sexuality, military, 
and popular culture.
