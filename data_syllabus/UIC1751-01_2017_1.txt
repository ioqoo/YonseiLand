This course will offer an interrogation of the assertion that not only is science unembodied (see quote above), but will challenge the idea that science’s embodiment is incidental and without consequence.  Specifically, we will examine how gender, gender-specific interests, and gender-specific experiences have impacted science as a means of knowledge production, and whether they should.  

It should go without saying?but it doesn’t so I am saying it?this is not a class “for women.”  This is a class for humans who wish to understand how gender-based power relations impact what claims we accept as true.  Bringing feminist concerns to bear upon the analysis of knowledge does not require being a woman.  Indeed, we begin by considering the argument that “Feminism is for Everybody.”

I expect that students come to class and section having read and given some thought to assigned material.  Such preparation will facilitate both a deeper understanding and livelier discussion.
