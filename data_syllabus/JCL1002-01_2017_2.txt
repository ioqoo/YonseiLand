This course is designed to introduce the basic concepts and problems of moral reasoning and critical judgment. 
In everyday life, human beings must encounter differing opinions that try to argue their own truths about the good or bad way of life. 
But in the contemporary age of value-pluralism and liberal democratic culture, we tend to overlook the moral problems as simply private issues, 
often judging that there is no righteous ground of our being in the polis. But to coexist in a proper way, 
the human beings must confront the ethical questions of everyday living with others and the political necessity to resolve them. 
Reading the classical texts of great thinkers, we will try to think about the questionable nature of our moral problems 
and the best-possible ground to deal with them.
