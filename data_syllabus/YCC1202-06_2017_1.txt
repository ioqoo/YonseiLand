This course takes an integrated skills approach. Class time will focus on the productive skill of writing as well as taking an analytical approach to reading.  Students will learn to deconstruct essays and identify the main components in order to help with their own writing.  Additional reading practice 
will be conducted outside class time to reinforce strategies learned in class.  Students will be responsible for creating a variety of writing exposes as 
the course progresses to reinforce writing strategies learned in class.  Students are also expected to actively participate in pair and small group 
activities where peer editing of each other’s work is encouraged. The instructor will monitor individual performance in terms of paragraph construction, vocabulary, grammar, comprehension and using effective communication in writing. Students will receive regular feedback in writing and offered tips 
and strategies to help enhance their writing skills.
Students will be given daily homework. This will include out-of-class activities (i.e. assigned reading passages, assigned writing activities,
research, project preparation, and online activities) as well as other assignments related to the course. Students should come to class prepared, 
having completed the assigned homework necessary to participate in class discussions and activities.
