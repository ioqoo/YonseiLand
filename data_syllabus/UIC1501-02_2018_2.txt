"Oceanic Histories" course follows up the essence and the patterns of Fernand Braudel‘s longue duree concept and examines the maritime history of the world’s oceans in their historical and historiographical relation within a traditional and transnational history. Based on the recently published volume called  "Oceanic Histories" (David Armitage et. al., eds.), the course takes an alternative approach to look at world history from longer historical genealogies of the oceans and seas whose histories are told from the “below,” below the waves and the surface of the oceans. This way contrasts with terra-centrism, the history from the land. The history of the oceans and seas reimagines connections between human and non-human history as well as human and non-human history with the physical environment. In this view, maritime histories provide us with a literally superficial view that does not penetrate beneath the surface.
