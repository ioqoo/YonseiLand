This course introduces students to the field of international studies, and 
serves as a foundation for future coursework in the International Studies 
major. Students will gain familiarity with the core disciplines of 
international studies: world history, international relations, 
international economics & international political economy, internalional law, and a variety of cultural studies 
and social science approaches to globalization. Students will learn these various 
disciplines by analyzing writings by leading theorists as well as practitioners in the field.

As we learn the disciplines, we will also explore some of the key issues in 
contemporary (post-Cold War) international studies, such as: the nature of 
historical change in the 20th and 21st centuries; the dilemma of sovereignty and universality, 
and debate between realism vs. liberalism vs. constructivism in contemporary 
IR theory; the balance of state vs. market, especially in an era 
of global financial crises & transnational security challenges; new concepts 
of identity in an era of cosmopolitanism and resurgent nationalism. 

Toward the end of the semester, students will prepare a group model debate in the format of the Six Party Talks, as a way to `practice` international conflict and cooperation. We will then zoom out, using the tools acquired over the course of the semester to `think big` about paradigms for intenrational affairs in recent decades and the decades to come.
