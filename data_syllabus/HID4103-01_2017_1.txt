The objectives of this course are to develop student’s ability understanding 
overall lighting design and the needs for lighting design process at the 
beginning of architectural design. 
This class consists of abstract projects that involve the exploration of 
fundamental design components: light, color, form, space, plane, rhythm, 
hierarchy, balance and texture. Projects will explore inside versus outside; 
what it means to illuminate space with light that is moving vertically, 
horizontally, even at an angle, or these conditions combined. Exercises 
include building small abstract environments and lighting them. Representing 
graphically lighting concepts, both diagrammatically as well as suggesting 
various source types and exploring the characteristics of various types of 
sources and effects to understand the difference in effect among point 
sources, line sources and area sources; and distinguish between direct or 
reflected light.
Course Projects will be supplemented by on-going journal assignment to observe 
and analyses existing architectural environment.
