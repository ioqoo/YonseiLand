College English Ⅰ is an integrated, two-credit course designed to 
broaden the academic listening and speaking skills of students at the high and 
advanced levels. The course exposes students to a variety of listening and 
speaking strategies necessary for successful communication in academic 
environments, as well as independent study at a tertiary level. Students will 
engage interactively in discussions, debates, speeches, and presentations. 
They will also be required to utilize various note taking methods for extended 
listening. Students will be encouraged to develop cooperative learning habits 
by working collaboratively in pairs and small groups. Students are also 
expected to create their own opportunities outside class-hours to further 
enhance their speaking and listening skills.
This course will enhance students’ speaking and listening skills for academic 
purposes. Students will participate in a variety of pre-prepared and 
spontaneous oral/aural projects that will help them consolidate the academic 
speaking and listening skills necessary to cope with university-level study. 
They will also be exposed to longer authentic listening passages for extended 
periods of time. Students will listen to and take notes on live and recorded 
lectures and use course topics to practice speaking skills required in 
academic settings. Through these practices, students will become both 
persuasive speakers and discerning listeners.
