This course provides students with an opportunity to learn how to systematically compare public policies. It pays attention to the reasons behind similarities and differences of public policies in different countries. The course consists of three parts. The first part of the course introduces and discusses concepts, theories, and methods in comparative public policy. The second part covers real-case comparisons for problem-solving. Key public policy issues are examined in comparative perspectives. Finally, while examining cross-national policy learning and policy transfers, the course discusses the importance of comparative public policy in policy-making and formulation. The key purpose of the course is to strengthen students` capacity to compare public policies, to devise policy alternatives, and to enhance the ability to make good public policies.

We will pay particular attention to social investment policies, knowledge-based economy, and welfare states in this year.
