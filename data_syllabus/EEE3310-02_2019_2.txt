This course provides an introduction to linear systems, transfer functions, 
and Laplace transforms. It covers stability and feedback, and provides basic 
design tools for specifications of transient response. It also covers 
frequency-domain design techniques.This course includes computer-aided control 
system design projects.

This course develops the fundamentals of feedback control using linear 
transfer function system models. Topics covered include analysis in time and 
frequency domains; design in the s-plane (root locus) and in the frequency 
domain (loop shaping); describing functions for stability of linear and 
certain non-linear systems; extension to state variable systems and conceptual 
discussion on multivariable control with observers: 

- Learn the process of modeling linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems 
in dual domains: in the time domain using ordinary differential equations and 
in the Laplace domain (s-domain).
- Understand the behavior of LTI systems qualitatively and quantitatively, 
both in the transient and steady-state regimes, and appreciate how it impacts 
the performance of electro-mechanical systems.
- Introduce feedback control and understand, using the s-domain primarily, how 
feedback impacts transient and steady-state performance.
- Learn how to design proportional, proportional-integral, proportional-
derivative, and proportional-integral-derivative feedback control systems 
meeting specific system performance requirements.
- Introduce qualitatively the frequency response of LTI systems and how it 
relates to the transient and steady-state system performance.
