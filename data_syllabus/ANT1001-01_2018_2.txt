This course introduces the basic concepts and primary domains of cultural anthropology, a discipline concerned with the diversity of human culture. Anthropology challenges us to (re)think about different ways of lives that are shaped by diverse social forces, cultural meanings, and historical contexts. Using illustrative and ethnographic materials and videos/documentary films, we will explore contemporary themes of human culture in anthropological perspectives. A particular concern in the course will be to familiarize students with global processes of social, political, and economic changes that are interconnected with our everyday lives. A broader goal of the course is to introduce students to the way anthropologists learn and think about the world.

By the end of this course, students are expected to:
1) Be open to diverse cultural experiences
2) Think critically and reflectively about cultural differences
3) Understand how anthropologists do fieldwork
4) Explore how the various components of a “culture” form an integrated whole
