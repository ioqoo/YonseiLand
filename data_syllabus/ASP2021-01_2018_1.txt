This course explores popular culture in modern Japanese history from the mid 
Tokugawa period to the present with a specific focus on historical 
transformations and theoretical analyses. This course is deigned to: 1) 
examine the constructed and contested nature of imaginations pertaining to the 
“popular” against the background of global and domestic changes; and 2) 
acquaint students with problems and theories of popular culture by treating 
Japan as a case study to be effectively elaborated in class discussions, mid-
term academic book reviews, and final essays. The course roughly follows the 
chronological order and sets a weekly theme discussing relevant
problems. The weekly class session alternates a lecture with a partial film screening and 
discussion facilitated by students. Students are expected to demonstrate 
skills in argumentative writing as well.
