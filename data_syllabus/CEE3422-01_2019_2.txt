River Engineering offers advanced issues on water resources-related subject. 
Students are required to use knowledge acquired in elementary fluid mechanics, 
hydraulics, and hydrology. As for fundamental issues, river morphology, 
streamflow measurements, open-channel hydraulics, water quality issues, and 
sediment transport are introduced. Foe engineering issues, general 
introduction, investigation of rivers, planning, in-stream structures, and 
urban streams are dealt. It is intended that students learn general features 
of rivers, role of river engineering, and how to manage rivers for both nature 
and human.

"River Engineering" is a course offered to senior students in the department 
of Civil & Environmental Engineering. The basic knowledge of elementary fluid 
mechanics, hydraulics, and hydrology is applied to engineering problems 
related with river. Engineering priciples on river improvement and river 
development will be introduced. Also, open-channel flow theory and mechanics 
of pollutant and sediment transports will also be covered.
