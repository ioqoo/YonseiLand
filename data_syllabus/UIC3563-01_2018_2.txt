Phenomenology represents one of the most ambitious philosophical projects of the twentieth century, and remains, till this day, a viable and fruitful avenue of philosophical research. The phenomenological movement, which starts with the seminal work of Edmund Husserl, believed that philosophers should cease attempting to provide reductive causal accounts of phenomena, and itself describe phenomena (things that appear) as they show themselves. While this seems simple, the phenomenological method is in fact quite challenging, and requires a radical  abstention from the ordinary common sense assumptions that we wake.

IN this course, we will study several basic texts from the phenomenological tradition, including Husserl`s Cartesian Meditations, selections from the first book of Heidegger`s Being and Time, and finally selections from two of the most important phenomenologists writing in French: Merleau-Ponty and Levinas.
