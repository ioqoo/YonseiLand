This course uses a series of case studies to look at the practice of 
diplomacy - i.e. how governments deal with each other and work together. 
It looks at questions like, who is involved in making international 
agreements, how do those agreements get made, what kinds of agreements are 
possible, and what kinds of factors can affect negotiations. 
Additionally, the course applies IR theories to real world cases. Many 
students learn these theories but then don`t understand how to use them, so 
the course will help to reconcile these abstract theories with the concrete 
realities of how IR actually works.
