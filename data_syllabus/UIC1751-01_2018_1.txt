The central theme of the course will be ways in which private industry distort scientific research and the extent to which industry-funded science can be relied upon. Industry funding has become the major source of income for scientific research.  In addition to economic forces causing this trend, a number of non-profit and government agencies (e.g. the Gates Foundation, the Wellcome trust, the Food and Drug Administration, etc.) are recommending more collaboration between industry and academia.  The entire field of biomedicine is undergoing a massive shift along these lines as pharmaceutical companies shift their R&D work into universities under the rubric of translational medicine.  Similarly, most of the work assessing the safety of industrial chemicals is conducted by the companies that produce them.  Yet concurrent with this shift towards industry funding, there has been growing concern with the ways in which industry has deliberately distorted scientific studies to produce results that serve their economic interest.  This course examines industry-funded science and asks is really “science.”  In short, is there any principled line that we can draw between “real science” and “pseudoscience” (i.e. something that might look like science, but is really isn’t).  Philosophers the demarcation question.  However, when philosophers talk about “pseudoscience” they consider cases like astrology or creationism.  In this class we will first look at several cases of industry funded science and then look at many different answers to the demarcation question and ask if any of the answers help explain the problematic cases of industry-funded research.
