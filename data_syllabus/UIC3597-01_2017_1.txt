Imagining Gender in Korean Film

How are notions of gender--femininity, masculinity, and in-between--represented and negotiated in film? How does film visualize the ways in which ideologies of power, desire, and discipline intersect with gender? What does film tell us about the different historical and socio-cultural constructions of gender and the "pathologies" of such constructions? How are contemporary debates surrounding gender reflected in, informed by, and imagined across the popular cultural medium of film?

From the "traditional" wise-mother, good-wife (hyonmoyangch`o) to the "modern" new woman (sinyosong), from the colonial "comfort woman" to the neo-colonial "western princess," from the post-War "militaristic man" to the post-IMF "emasculated man," from the domestic housewife to the global foreign bride, this course explores how (r)evolving constructions of gender are molded, disseminated, altered, and subverted in (South) Korean film.

With the understanding that film--as a cultural product--cannot exist in a vacuum, we will consider a wide array of films amid the major upheavals and transformations of Korea. While South Korea appears to have made remarkable strides toward gender equality, entrenched "normative" values about gender (and sex and sexuality) continue to haunt and injure its society. Our aim is to critically excavate and question issues of gender so as to foster positive and ethical change.
