The GWG(global warming gases) are increasing by using the fossil fuel. CO2 is 
a major GWG and has a direct relationship with fossil fuel such as coal, oil 
and LNG. The major sources consist of power plant, industry, transportation 
and so on. In order to prevent the global warming of CO2, there are three 
strategies first the energy saving and improving efficiency to decrease the 
amount of fossil fuel second the development of renewable energy in stead of 
conventional fossil fuel third CO2 reducing technologies including the CCS 
(CO2 capture and storage). We will discuss a lots of technologies concerned in 
this research areaes.
