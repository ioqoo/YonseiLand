While "politics" has now become a universal term for all the activities associated with all manner of human governance, the word originated in a very specific historical context: the city-state (polis) of Ancient Greece. The polis, and especially the democratic polis of Athens, represented an unusual experiment in the organization of human life, and indeed the polis, in a strict sense, only really thrived for a few hundred centuries. Yet it is not only the concept of politics, as well as the scientific, rational study of the political, that arose during this short and exceptional period of human history, but also many other concepts that have subsequently come to be regarded as of universal value, including philosophy, science, and reason.  
The aim of this course is to study key texts of Classical Greek political thought, ranging from the Presocratics and Sophists and early Platonic dialogues, to the middle and late works of Plato, and, finally the ethical and political thought of Aristotle.
