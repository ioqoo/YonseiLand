Transnational Modernism 

In the past two decades, modernist studies has directed attention to modernismâ€™s transnational flows, 
rejecting notions of mimicry and belatedness traditionally attributed to so-called peripheral literatures.
Put another way, efforts are underway to decenter Euro-American modernism and no longer treat literary 
works from the global South and Asia as inferior imitations of Western models. Our concern in this course, 
then, will be to read modernist works from previously neglected regions of the globe, while considering the 
ways in which they engage in critical dialogues with texts from the West. Along with the literature, we will 
also be reading some of the recent criticism concerned with transnationalism, cosmopolitanism, and the planetary.
