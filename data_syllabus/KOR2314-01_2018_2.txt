This is a course designed specifically for students from the University of California Education Abroad Program and the Department of Korean Language and Literature at Yonsei University. In partnership with the Center for Innovation in Higher Education, this course is designed to give students the opportunity to learn about Korean society and culture through digital media. Lectures and discussions will be supplemented with regular meetings with a language partner. Particular attention will be given to critically examining the socio-cultural impact of new digital technologies and media forms such as webtoons, mmorpg games, blogs, and other SNS sites and the institutions that control these technologies. The course assignments and projects will entail working with a number of digital forms (e.g., photography, video, data, social media, etc.), culminating with a final 7-10 minute digital story presentation project. While no prior experience with digital media is required, a willingness to learn from your language partner is key.
