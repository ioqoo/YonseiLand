Processes of globalization, migration, marketization, and socioeconomic change have transformed the landscape of children’s educational and occupational trajectories across the world. This course explores how such broader macro-level changes have influenced micro-level experiences, interactions, and individual beliefs influencing learning and schooling. 

This course will cover various topics from the home environment to structural and cultural factors shaping learning experiences through lectures and a discussion of readings. Students will also have the unique opportunity throughout this course to pursue a project of their own interest relevant to the topics covered in the course. The instructor will closely guide student projects. 

This course aims to: 1) familiarize students with key contextual factors shaping education and develop students’ ability to think in a cross-cultural and international perspective by introducing case studies across the world; 2) train students to be able to fluently read and understand empirical research papers written in English; 3) support students’ writing and presentation skills through continuous support provided by the instructor and a community of peers by giving opportunities for detailed feedback and revisions; 4) expose students to research by providing them with an opportunity to formulate their own projects.
