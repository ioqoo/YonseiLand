This course surveys the history of modern France from 1750 to the present day. Though chronological in approach, this course addresses the broad themes of ethnic and national identity, religion, political change and leadership, gender, and the experience of war and occupation. We will read and discuss a broad range of primary sources (in English translation) including pamphlets, caricatures, speeches, diaries, newspapers, songs, photographs, novels, advertisements, and film.

Syllabus_English
##
The course is taught in English, and all materials are in English. I also expect that when you are sitting in my classroom (even before class or discussion has started) that you are speaking English. For me, English is a way for people from multiple ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds to communicate in a shared space without social distinction. Private conversations in a language other than English unintentionally create barriers between students.
