The study of genetics focuses on understanding phenotypic variation and the 
mechanisms underlying inheritance.  The processes that participate in 
converting an individualâ€™s genotype into the phenotypes displayed by that 
individual are of particular interest and importance.  In this course we will 
discuss the fundamental properties of genes and the various approaches to 
genetic analysis, as it is performed in several different model organisms.  
When applicable, we will discuss current examples of genetics issues that 
arise in the literature or in the media and link these examples to topics 
covered in class.
