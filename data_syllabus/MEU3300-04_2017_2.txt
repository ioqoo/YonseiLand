***Design and performance analysis of creative solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) packaging***

Throughout this course, students will be learning how to obtain thermal-fluid engineering designs for an electrochemical energy conversion system (SOFC, one of renewable energy technologies) by using numerical simulations.
- Understand the fundamental multi-physics of SOFC operations
- Perform numerical simulations for the given base-case design
- Determine key design parameters for SOFC packaging (i.e., interconnect design)
- Obtain design improvement for enhancing thermal-fluid uniformity within the packaging
- Compare and analyze the performance of the base-case and new designs
