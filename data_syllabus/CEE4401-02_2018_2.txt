The goal of the course is to understand behaviors of three major materials in 
civil engineering, which are concrete, metal and geotechnical materials. 
Behaviors of each material will be covered by specialized faculty members. 
This course provides opportunities for students to be exposed to laboratory 
experiences. Especially for steel structure, the course will cover tensile 
test using universal testing machine, measurement of strain using strain 
gauge, behavior of a beam and dynamic behavior of a structure.
