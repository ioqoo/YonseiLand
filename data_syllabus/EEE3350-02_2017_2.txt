The goal of this course to describe the role of power electronics in “power 
processing” to utilize power and energy as efficiently as possible, with 
applications ranging from small cell phones, medical devices, and electric vehicles to harnessing 
of wind and solar energy, and reliable delivery of power and efficient end-
use (appliances and electronics, etc.). Special emphasis will be put on the electric vehicles and power electronics-based 
transmission/distribution controllers (e.g. HVDC, FACTS and ESS applications) in the last few lectures due to 
emerging interests in this area.
