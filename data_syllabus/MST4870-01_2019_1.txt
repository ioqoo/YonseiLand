“Nature is by far the greatest engineer and materials scientist”. Nature has evolved millions of years in complexity, especially in plants and animals with unique functions: self-cleaning of lotus leaf, lizard’s ability to walk on walls without falling down, self-healing of earthworm, water collecting of desert beetles, as examples. Biomimetics deals with technology and new materials and devices in mimicking those functions in Nature. In this course, fundamental principles, fabrication, and its application of various biomimetic systems will be covered.
