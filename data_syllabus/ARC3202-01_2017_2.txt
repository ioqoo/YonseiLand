The physical significance of material properties in structural engineering is explained.

Constitutive equation for the relationship between force and deformation is discussed along with important material properties 
such as Young`s Modulus and Poisson`s Ratio.

In the lab. the properties of steel and concrete are measured. Team projects are assigned to use advanced testing equipments such as 
ultrasonic testing machines and wireless sensor systems ETC.
