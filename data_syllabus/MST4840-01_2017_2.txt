This course describes the fundamental chemical thermodynamics and transport 
phenomena involved in high temperature processing of ferrrous and non-ferrrous metals. We will focus on 
the key topics relevant to the reduction and refining steps to industrial 
scale metals production including steels, aluminum, copper, titanium, 
magnesium etc. We will also reflect and discuss the environmental impact of 
process wastes generated and current technology in waste recycling from these 
applied thermal processes.
