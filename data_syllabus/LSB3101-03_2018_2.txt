Cells are composed of numerous biomolecules, and many of them are 
macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids.  
Understand of functional properties of the biological macromolecules is first 
step towards appreciation of highly integrative organized, and robust 
biological processes of the cells.  In this lecture, we will discuss about 
relationship between chemical structures and biochemical functions for many 
cellular macromolecules.  We will also discuss about various experimental and 
analytical approaches to study structure and function of those biomolecules.
