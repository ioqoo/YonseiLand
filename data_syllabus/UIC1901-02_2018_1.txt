The aim of this course is to introduce students to philosophy through reading Ethics, the major work of the 17th century Dutch-Jewish philosopher, Baruch Spinoza. In this work, Spinoza famously defends the view that God isn`t a person, or any supernatural entity, but rather Nature itself ? the world as a whole. The book culminates in Spinoza`s defense of the Christian notion that the best kind of life is one grounded in the love of God. However, given that he thinks God is just Nature, what Spinoza is proposing is that the best kind of life is one in which we relate to Nature in some way that parallels the way we relate to a beloved person whom we love. In doing so, he re-conceives the nature of religion and the religious life, and offers highly unothodox readings of themes and doctrines from the Judeo-Christian tradition. Our goal in the class is to understand Spinoza’s conception of religion. Along the way, however, we will talk about the many themes in metaphysics, philosophy of mind, ethics, and political philosophy that Spinoza addresses. And, in order to understand Spinoza’s views, we will read classical religious texts, as well as the work of a number of other philosophers.
