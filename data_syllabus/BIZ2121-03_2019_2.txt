Operations management involves the integration of numerous activities and processes to produce products and services in a highly competitive global environment. Many companies have experienced a decline in market share as a result of their inability to compete on the basis of responsiveness, cost or quality. Most now agree that world class performance in operations is essential for competitive success and long-term survival. We consider key performance measures of operations (productivity, flexibility, quality, and response time) as well as important concepts for improving the performance of operations along these dimensions. At the end of the course, students will have a fair understanding of the role that operations management plays in business processes. Emphasis is given both to familiarization with various production processes and service systems, and to quantitative analysis of problems arising in the management of operations.
