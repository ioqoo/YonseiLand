Ever since Kafka’s stories and fragmentary novels began to appear, readers have recognized a difficult interpretative problem, which can be briefly described in the following way:  even if no “moral” or “doctrine” governs Kafka’s work, it nevertheless still seems to teach us something that is otherwise inaccessible.  The following question therefore arises:  what is the content of his teaching, the “doctrine” that can be extracted from immersion in his work?   Among the first and most significant attempts to reflect on the source of this question?and propose an answer that does not betray the integrity of Kafka’s idea of literature?is found in Walter Benjamin’s late writings.  The aim of this seminar is to read Kafka’s writings in light of Benjamin’s critical program and, conversely, to analyze, from the perspective of its conception of literature, the critical program Benjamin began to pursue soon after he became acquainted with Kafka’s work.  The texts under consideration will be:  some of Kafka’s so-called “Z?rau Fragments,” his short story entitled “The Judgment,” a selection of his animal stories, and the first and final chapters of his unfinished novel The One Who Disappeared (also known as Amerika); Benjamin’s 1934 essay “Franz Kafka: On the Tenth Anniversary of His Death,” some of his conversations with Brecht, a letter he wrote to Gershom Scholem on Kafka, and a small selection of reflections on the idea of the dialectical image, and his “Theological-Political Fragment.”
