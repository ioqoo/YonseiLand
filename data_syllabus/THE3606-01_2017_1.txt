The main purpose is to explore recently global approaches of the curriculum of religious education to encourage our faith and our understanding of the Son of God, JESUS CHRIST, for reshaping our Christian identities in an era of post-conventional sociaty and in depth of post-global transition. "This will continue until we are united by our faith and by our understanding of the Son of God. Then we will be mature, just as Christ, and we will be completely like him" (Ephesians 4:13).
