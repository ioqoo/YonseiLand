Feminism refers to the philosophy, ideology, and socio-political practices that women, men, and social subjects participate in, with the goal of redefining existing structures of hetero-patriarchal dominations and inequality. In this class, we will push some of the following questions to their theoretical limits: in what ways is biological notion of sex really distinct from a conventional notion of gender as a socially ascribed category? How does a poststructuralist account of sex and gender challenge the biological essentialism of sex itself? How are feminist struggles across East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia parallel and comparable to each other in their shared political aspirations? How does war and militarism in fact mobilize and depend on sexual labour that demands a transnational analysis attentive to the hegemony of empire and colonialism? Finally, how might we locate and imagine transnational politics of feminism in this post-Cold War yet continual militarized present in Asia? The aim of this course is twofold: to introduce feminism as a powerful analytical lens to read history, literature, theory, and real lives rather than simply another marginalized sub-discipline of social theory; secondly, we will study Asian forms of feminism in its historicity, theory, and political aspirations. Students are not expected to have background knowledge in feminist theory. An open mind and rigorous engagement with the readings are expected and required.
