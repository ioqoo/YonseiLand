This is a basic course in stochastic processes with emphasis on model building 
and probabilistic reasoning. The approach will however be rigorous. Topics to 
be covered include a review of elementary probability theory with particular 
attention to conditional expectation; the Poisson process; Markov chains; 
Markov decision process; and some continuous state models including the 
Wienier process. Applications will be considered in queuing and inventory 
theory.
