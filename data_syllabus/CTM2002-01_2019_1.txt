Two exams will include subjective and objective questions in short answer and 
possibly essay formats. This exam will require you to know the material 
discussed in class lectures as well as the material in the assigned readings.

studied your class notes, the focus of the test will generally be to assess 
the extent to which you can integrate and apply the knowledge acquired.
