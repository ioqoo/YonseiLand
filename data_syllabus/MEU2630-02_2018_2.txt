##
Every moving mechanical system is composed of mechanism components, which are, 
for example, link, cam, gear and etc. In this course, students learn the 
analytical skills to analyze the motion of such components. Then, students 
also learn how to synthesize mechanisms in order to make desired motions.
Finally, students are to do term projects so as to have hands-on experiences.

##
Any moving mechanical system is composed of mechanism. The major components of 
mechanisms are link, cam gear, and etc. About half of the semester consists of 
analyses on motion(position, velocity, acceleration) of theses components. In 
another half of the semester, the students will learn about how to design 
mechanisms so as to aquire desired motion functions of mechanisms.
