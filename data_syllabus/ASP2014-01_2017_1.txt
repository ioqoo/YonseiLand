We begin by looking at how the Cold War was a global conflict that created mutually hostile, politically and culturally divided zones. This conflict mobilized just about everyone: for example, from black jazz musicians who were sent all over the world (by the U.S. State Department) to win hearts and minds, to middle class American families that adopted Korean “orphans,” to Korean writers who rendered the other half of Korea “invisible.”   

We will be reminded that the Cold War in East Asia involved “hot” wars that tore apart land, flesh, as well as neighborly trust. Here, our point of departure will be the collapse of the Japanese empire in 1945, and the collision between American and Soviet interventions on the one hand and local political movements on the other. 

Keeping in mind the historical situations in which communist and anti-communist regimes were established and consolidated, we will examine key events, ideas, and practices that establish(ed) strict limits on cultural and political expression, and sustained “war politics” on the Korean peninsula. We will end the course by looking at the aftermath of communism, and Koreans who live astride state borders in post-socialist East Asia.
