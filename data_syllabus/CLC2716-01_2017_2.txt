We should keep in mind that history is not just dry facts. It`s how you use those facts to explain historical change and historical phenomena. That`s important. In this course, we will intensively deal with case studies of East Asian visual cultures in the premodern period and with the Inter-disciplinary approach and a comparative cultural point of view.

First of all, in order to understand East Asian history and cultural context, we will briefly explore visual cultures of  China, Japan and Korea. And, as a case study, we will approach the social history of art through their representative landscape paintings  between the 14th to 19th centuries. Also, in order to think about the key concept of East Asian art and to conduct cultural exchange and comparative research among Korea and her neighboring countries, all attendants will plan an exhibition on the theme of "East Asian Beauty in a specific period eye". The exhibition planning and presentation for each case study will be organized by a team, and the final essay will be submitted for the individual viewpoint.
