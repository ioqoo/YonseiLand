How has the history of the Twentieth Century shaped the world in which we live today? How do historians think and write about the important ideas, events and processes of the century? This introductory course is aimed at students who would like to gain an understanding of the major themes and transitions of modern world history and the skills and methods of professional historical study. 

Work inside and outside of classes is shaped towards producing a final assignment, which should reflect students’ awareness of the relationship between the past and the present. The course is therefore concerned with awareness of our place in the world and ‘how we got here’, and a sense of how the past continues to shape our everyday lives. This also involves understanding that complexity, contradiction and conflict are part of the story: For example, how are historical narratives constructed? How are they appropriated and reconstructed? By the end of this course, my hope is that students will take with them the critical analytical skills allied to creative and sensitive reflection that is characteristic of being able to think historically.  

The themes of the course range from nationalism, imperialism and modernism to mass culture, decolonization, and globalization. These will be explored through thematic lectures, weekly readings, and class discussions. Assessment will be in the form of quizzes, group work, written papers, and a longer end of term assignment.
