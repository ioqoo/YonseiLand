The expansion of British dominions after the Seven Years’ War led George Macartney and fellow imperial managers to characterize their “vast empire on which the sun never sets, and whose bounds nature has not yet ascertained” as a global hegemonic power. This remarkable claim was rooted in the early modern construction of British commonwealths. As British men and women of all ranks, engaged virtually (via print and material culture) and directly (via colonization, commerce, and war) with imperialism, these experiences provided sufficient incentive to identify themselves in different ways as citizens or victims of a globalizing commonwealth. Distinct types of commonwealth emerged in response to the early modern formation of the state and enlarged civil liberties. In practice, commonwealths generally functioned as mediating corporations between societal values and their government. This seminar introduces students to the global history of the British Empire by considering the longue dur?e imperium of commonwealths throughout British Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceanic worlds between c.1500 and 1960. A research-based approach to teaching and learning will be taken throughout, partly by drawing directly on the course organizer’s own research, and the analysis of seminal texts in each seminar. Upon completing this seminar, students will be familiar with situating the social, political, cultural, and intellectual history of commonwealths in global, imperial, national, colonial, and postcolonial contexts of the British world.
