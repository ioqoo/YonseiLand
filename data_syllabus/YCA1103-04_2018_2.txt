The Holy Bible, the canon of Christianity, has laid the foundation of Christian doctrine, theology, and culture.

This course aims at a brief investigation of the Bibleâ€™s contribution to the development of a few streams of Christian doctrine and theology.

We will attempt to foster a critical understanding of four main contributors to Christian theology, Augustine, Aquinas, Kant, and Kierkegaard, and their methods of interpreting the Bible.
