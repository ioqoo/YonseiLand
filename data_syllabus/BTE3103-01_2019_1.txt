Food biochemistry is concerned with the principles of biochemistry which underlie the structure and behavior of substance and matter in food. It provides updated information on fundamental topics such as sugars, polysaccharide, lipids, proteins, colours, flavors, preservatives, enzyme, functional foods, and dietary supplements. Each of these areas is directly related to the current effort of commercializing food products and adding new value to them. The successful application of this knowledge is ultimately essential to the development and growth of major aspects of food science, including production, processing, preservation, distribution, safety, and engineering and technology.
