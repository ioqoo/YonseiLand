The primary purpose of this course is to analyze the formulation and solution 
of representative problems that arise in the biological sciences and are 
modeled 
by differential equations. In this course, we begin with studying ordinary 
differential equations and their application  to the biological mechanic. We 
study systems of differential equations which occur in various applications. 
We  study Laplace transforms and  Fourier series and the wave equation and the 
heat equation and their application to the biological science.
