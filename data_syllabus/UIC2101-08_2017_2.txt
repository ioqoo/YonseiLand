This course is designed as a forum in which you can reflect deeply and extensively on 
reasoning--and in particular, on what differentiates good reasoning from bad reasoning.  
We`ll follow two approaches in the course, looking first at some accounts of good 
reasoning that have been proposed by logicians and then turning to examine some 
philosophical questions about the nature of good reasoning.  Over the course of the 
semester, you`ll have opportunities to consider:

(i) Some foundational logical concepts and techniques pertaining to the nature of 
arguments, the distinction between good and bad arguments, and logical fallacies;

(ii) Psychological and philosophical findings regarding the effects of implicit bias on our 
reasoning and thought; and

(iii) Philosophical issues pertaining to the ways in which we do--and ought to--reason 
about morality.

Insofar as the course tackles both theoretical and applied topics, my hope is that it will 
prove useful to students with diverse academic backgrounds and interests.  By the end of 
the course, you should acquire a better appreciation of how to reason well and how, in 
particular, to reason well when making moral decisions.
