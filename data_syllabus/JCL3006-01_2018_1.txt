What is the ‘law?’ What informs it? When is it ‘valid’ and why do we respect it? How is the law different from an autocrat’s commands? Are law and ‘justice’ always the same? If not, do we have a duty to always respect the law? To address these and related questions, we consider the law’s nature, norms, and justifications. Our core question is: When can a ‘rule’ be structurally and morally classified as ‘law?’ 

Our approach is interdisciplinary, drawing on philosophy, ethics, and law. The course covers major twentieth- and twenty-first century schools of legal philosophy, especially Legal Positivism, Natural Law, American Legal Realism, and Critical Legal Studies. Because legal philosophy affects and is affected by political-social-economic issues, we will periodically consider historical and contemporary issues, combining the theoretical with the practical. We conclude the class examining theoretical foundations for rights. Class discussions and activities are integrated with lectures. Students will improve analytical, writing, discussion, and presentation skills through these activities.

No prior knowledge is required.
