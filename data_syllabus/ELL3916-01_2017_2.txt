Poetry, Drama, and Performance walks students through the basics of poetry and 
drama, paying special attention to the sounds of the English language. We do 
extensive analyses of the meaning of the texts in relation to their sound 
qualities (rhyme, rhythm, meter, alliteration, assonance, onomatopoeia, etc.).

After a successful passage of the course, the student will be able to analyze 
poetry and dramatic verse based on the sound qualities of the texts. The 
student will also be able to apply the analysis to the performance of the 
texts, thus deepening their understanding of the English literary language.
