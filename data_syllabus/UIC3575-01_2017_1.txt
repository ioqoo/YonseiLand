What were the preconditions, proximate causes and precipitants for 
the Nazi seizure of power? Why and how did they carry out so many crimes? 
Recently historians of Germany have begun to answer these questions by 
turning towards Germany`s imperial past and aspirations for a continental empire.
This UIC seminar, Modern German History: Nazi Empire, will survey the history of 
Germany from 1871 to 1945 through the lens of empire and the tension between ethnic 
homogeneity and diversity.

The course is taught in English, and all materials are in English. I also 
expect that when you are sitting in my classroom (even before class or 
discussion has started) that you are speaking English. For me, English is a 
way for people from multiple ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds to 
communicate in a shared space without social distinction. Private 
conversations in a language other than English unintentionally create barriers 
between students.
