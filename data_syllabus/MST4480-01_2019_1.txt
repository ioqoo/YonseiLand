##
The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to information 
storage materials, which are based on electron spin. The course begins with 
the fundamentals of electromagnetism, quantum physics, and solid-state 
physics, related to physics of magnetism and extends to application of 
magnetic materials for information storage. 

In particular, it covers “spintronics”, a rapidly emerging research field, 
investigating spin-based electronic device applications. Main topics include: 
fundamental magnetism and magnetic materials, spintronics, and important 
applications such as hard disk drive (HDD) and spin field effect transistor 
(FET).
