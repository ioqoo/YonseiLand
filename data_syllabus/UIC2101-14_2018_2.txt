The essence of critical thinking lies in accepting good arguments and weeding out bad arguments. It is about accepting the conclusions that are well supported by the premises from which they are drawn. Logic provides us with the standards by which we can evaluate arguments. By studying logic, you will be able to better evaluate your own thinking or resaoning, as well as the arguments presented by others. In this course, you will be expected to:

(i) develop basic techniques for recognizing, reconstructing, and evaluating arguments;
(ii) learn how to use formal logic to construct proofs and test deductive arguments;
(iii) familiarize yourself with formal and informal fallacies that should be guarded agaisnt; and
(iv) become acquainted with basic rules of inductive logic.

More specifically, you will learn about different types of arguments, some basic logical concepts by means of which we can assess arguments (such as validity, soundness, cogency, etc.), and practice reconstructing and analyzing ordianary arguments. We will also cover the basic of propositional logic, as well as categorical logic, where you will be expected learn skills to symbolize ordinary arguments and evaluate their validity. As for inductive logic, we`ll cover moral and causal arguments, as well as how to reason with probabilities.
