Where do our beliefs about right and wrong come from? What factors influence our decisions on whether an action is moral or immoral? Can science contribute to our understanding of our beliefs about right and wrong? Or is morality a separate sphere that science can never fully explain? We will explore these questions by examining central empirical studies in the cognitive sciences on how we form moral beliefs, make moral decisions, and engage in moral reasoning. Specific topics for this course include: whether moral beliefs are innate or the result of learning; to what extent moral decisions are based on reasoning or emotions; whether evolutionary theory can explain our moral attitudes about altruism, sexual promiscuity, and other topics; and whether our natural propensity to act self-interestedly places limits on our duties to help others. We will also investigate the influence on moral decision-making of factors that are typically outside our conscious reflective control, including the potential influence of relatively unconscious, implicit attitudes towards different genders, races, religions and sexual orientations. By the end of this course you will be familiar with a variety of provocative, contemporary debates in moral psychology that seek to challenge?or at least provide a new perspective on?our ordinary ways of thinking about what is good, what is right, and how we have come to hold the moral beliefs we do.
