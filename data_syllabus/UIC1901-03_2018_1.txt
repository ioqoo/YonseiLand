Philosophy is the love and pursuit of wisdom, and it still matters a lot to our lives and society. This course introduces you to the great ideas philosophers have come up with over the past two thousand years. We start our discussions with the nature of philosophy ? what philosophy is and why it still matters to us ? by considering the views of ancient Greek philosophers, Socrates and Plato. For the first half, we will explore some fundamental theoretical questions in philosophy ? the nature of human beings and the mind-body problem. Are humans rational by nature? Is our mind something distinct from the body? Then we move on to the more speculative topics in philosophy ? the problem of reality and the existence of God.

For the second half of this course, we first discuss the philosophy problem of knowledge and truth. How do we know that we know anything? What is the source of knowledge ? experience or reason? What is the truth, and how does it differ from mere beliefs? Finally, we come to the philosophical questions belonging to ethics and social philosophy. What is the right thing to do, both as an individual and as a society as a whole? What is a just society, and how to realize justice in a political system?

This course aims not only to familiarize you with philosophers and philosophical issues but also to improve your ability to think critically and autonomously and express your own ideas clearly and persuasively. Students are encouraged to participate actively in class discussions. They will also be asked to write short papers, give short presentations about given topics and take quizzes toward their final grades. There is no requirement for this course although basic reading and writing skills in English are expected.
