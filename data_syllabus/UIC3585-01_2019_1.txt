Up until the twentieth century, when Germany became known for more sinister 
things, it was known, perhaps above all, as the “Land of Thinkers and 
Poets.” Indeed: while Germany remained economically and politically something 
of a backwater throughout much of modern European history, it was also home to 
some of the most revolutionary and exciting philosophical revolutions of the 
last 250 years. Indeed; it is not only impossible to imagine what philosophy 
would look like without the revolution initiated by Kant in the quiet city of 
Königsberg, but it is also impossible to imagine what the world would look 
like: Marxism, Modernism and Post-Modernism, Fascism and Neo-Liberalism are 
all, in different ways, the intellectual children of German philosophy. And 
thus one can say without qualification: if we do not have some understanding 
of German philosophy, we cannot hope to understand the world in which we live.
The aim of this course is to provide students with a survey of some of the 
major texts of the German philosophical tradition. These texts cover a diverse 
range of topics, including epistemology, aesthetics, the philosophy of 
history, and political philosophy and economics. This course should thus also 
serve as a historical introduction to the “Continental” tradition of 
philosophy.
