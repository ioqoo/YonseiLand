This course explores a corpus of authorized texts that constitute “modern 
Japanese literature” of Meiji (1868-1912), Taishō (1912-1926) and early Shōwa 
period (1926-1989). Some of our primary concerns throughout the course will be 
to examine modernity as reflected in and informed by the course readings; 
debates and literary movements that characterize the formation of Japan’s 
literary canon; and the emergence of modern subject. Whereas the content of 
this course is shaped in part by the requirement to critically engage with the 
object of this course, “modern Japanese literature,” we shall do so while 
focusing on the manifestations of Japan’s modernity and addressing the issues 
of ‘canon’ and ‘nation-ness’.
