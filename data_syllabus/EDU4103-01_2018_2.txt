The major purpose of this course is to enhance students` theoretical understandings and practical competences in mainly developing curriculum and 
partly in constructing assessment tools relevant for the curriculum. Students will read a variety of readings mostly written in English dealing with diverse aspects of school curriculum. Even though the primary language of this course will be English, it will focus on issues and challenges within the context of Korean education. In addition to readings, students will join various activities such as discussions, group activities, and presentations. As such, it is strongly recommended that students are well prepared for the class by reading assigned materials before they come to each class. Even though this course will be taught in English, the instructor will attempt to minimize the impact of studentsâ€™ language capacity on their grades. In other words, what is more counted in this class is the intellectual commitment and willingness to face a challenge, not just English capacity.
