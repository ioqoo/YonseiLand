This course provides an overview of data manipulation and information management in the context of the emerging digital technologies.  Individually each of the technologies is relatively straightforward but cumulatively they are changing almost every aspect of human society.  Thus, we briefly examine specific techniques such as GIS, Python programming, and statistical workflow packages but we also consider broader issues such as service science and supporting access to quality information.
