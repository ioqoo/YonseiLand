As media and art histories testify, technological and aesthetic characteristics 
of media and art have reflected, informed, challenged, or transformed our way 
of thinking and living, including a vision of the world we live in--or we hope 
to live in.  This course aims to examine some of the scope and ramifications of 
media and art practices in modern society.  Part 1 will be organized around 
various, eclectic themes/media forms.  By exploring some theoretical accounts 
on “old,” un/usual media/art (e.g., writing, photography, film, radio, and t
the train), we can identify the recurring questions and apply them in a more c
contemporary setting.  Part II will further deepen the understanding of media, a
art, and society by introducing you to some current topics central to political a
and ethical discourses surrounding the practices of (not) looking, seeing, w
watching, or witnessing.  You will be expected to engage in serious reading, r
reflection, discussion, and writing on several topics that are guaranteed to be a
an important part of our mediated public life.
