This introductory course will expose students to the key considerations 
involved in creating narrative (story-based) films while they apply lessons 
learned in the classroom to the production of three digital video shorts.
In class, we will watch and critique student exercises, short films from 
around the world, and clips from classic & contemporary features--some good, 
some bad, some even a little weird, but all conducive to engaging classroom 
discussion. Our discussions will be complemented by readings that enhance 
student understanding of the thought processes and practical considerations 
involved in narrative filmmaking--shot selection and progressions, elements of 
dramatic narrative, working with actors, etc. We may also turn on the camera 
for in-class demonstrations.

This course is geared toward low-/no-budget filmmaking in consideration of 
equipment constraints and for pedagogical reasons--it`s not about fancy sets 
or costumes, and it`s not about who can spend the most money. This course 
aims to strip filmmaking to the essentials, providing a safety net for 
beginning filmmakers as they learn how to service a story through 
manipulation of the moving image.

Even those don`t intend to work in film may find that what they learn in 
this course can be applied to other fields. Although I hope that 
students will take the course out of a pure interest in filmmaking, some may 
find that enhancing their abilities to work with narratives, analyze human 
behavior, engage in creative problem solving, provide constructive criticism, 
and work productively in groups can be useful not only in film and other 
media, but also in diplomacy, business, and law.
