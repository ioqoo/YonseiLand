Intermediate English for the Global Leadership College is a four skills, three-credit course designed to improve the academic English skills for students at the intermediate level (CEF A2 and B1).

In the classroom, learner involvement, interaction, and critical thinking are highly encouraged and promoted. To ensure the acquisition of the core language functions, students will utilize a variety of listening, speaking, reading and writing strategies necessary to participate in discussions and presentations, and to write clear, concise, well-organized English compositions.

Students will gain confidence functioning in an academic English-speaking environment. They will be exposed to authentic listening materials such as news or lectures, and readings that develop their knowledge of the subject matter and writing organization.

Also, by understanding the structure of a paragraph, or report, and rhetorical modes, students will be able to apply their critical reading skills to organize their ideas into coherent and cohesive writing. Through these practices, students will become active readers and listeners and effective speakers and writers.
