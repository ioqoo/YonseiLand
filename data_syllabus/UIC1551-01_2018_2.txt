A History of Japan
This course surveys Japanese history from ancient times to 1945 by focusing on basic historical concepts, events and figures. We will trace major political, economic, social and cultural transformations in Japanese history to examine the historical development of several institutions which have continued to exist until today as a social foundation. By putting world history also into our consideration as a context where the discontinuities and continuities in Japanese history could occur, we will seek for a comprehensive understanding of Japan and the world.
