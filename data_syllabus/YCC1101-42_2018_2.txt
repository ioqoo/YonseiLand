This course is an integrated two-credit blended learning format designed to improve academic listening and speaking for students at the intermediate level. Students will develop their oral and aural competencies that are essential to successfully communicate in an academic environment.  In the classroom, learner involvement, interaction, and critical thinking are highly encouraged and promoted.  To ensure the acquisition of the core language functions, students will utilize a variety of listening and speaking strategies necessary to participate in discussions, presentations, and listening exercises. 
Students will gain confidence functioning in an academic English-speaking environment.  They will be exposed to authentic listening materials such as news, lectures, or other materials.  By participating in group discussions and oral projects, students will develop their academic English oral and aural skills. Through these practices, students will become both active speakers and strategic listeners.
