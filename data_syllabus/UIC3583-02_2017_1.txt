This seminar introduces students to the history of the early modern English world between c. 1450 and 1640 by focusing on two of its central themes: empire &
 commonwealth. Distinct types of “commonwealth” emerged in response to early modern formations of the state, imperial activities, and enlarged civil liberties. These 
“commonwealths” functioned as mediating corporations between societal values and their government. In a more inclusive way the early modern commonwealth generally
 signified an ideology of civic welfare throughout expanding domestic and imperial domains of the English world. As British men and women of all ranks engaged virtually
 with expanding imperial markets via print and material culture, these experiences gave them sufficient incentive to take a more proactive approach in running an empire. 
We shall study these transformations of conceptual “commonwealths” and English identity in an interdisciplinary and global fashion as a gateway into the ages of piracy and 
exploration. Our methods will be interdisciplinary, for we shall draw on the resources of literary criticism, political economy, and historical analysis to interpret a series of
 primary texts. Our approach will be global, for the texts we read will be drawn from intercultural interlocutions throughout the Atlantic, Mediterranean, Pacific, and Indian 
oceanic worlds. This course has no prerequisites and assumes no prior knowledge of early modern Global Intellectual History. A research-based approach to teaching and
 learning will be taken throughout, partly by drawing directly on the professor’s own research, and through a focus on the analysis of primary source material in each class.
