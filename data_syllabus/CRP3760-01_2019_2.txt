This course is designed to provide students with a conceptual understanding of geographic information systems (GIS) and sciences, as well as how GIS can be applied to planning practice and research. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts, structures, and functions of GIS as well as their applications and limitations. Topics include the history of GIS, data types, formats and sources, map design and visualization techniques, projection, spatial analysis techniques, and ethical and social criticism of GIS. During the lab sessions, the students will learn the basic functions of ArcGIS, in order to produce quality map products and to conduct basic spatial analysis. This course is letter grade only. Although there are no prerequisites, it is expected that students have basic computer operating skills and are familiar with the use of spreadsheet software (such as Excel) which assists in processing data for use in GIS.  To make the course more applicable to student interests, local data and examples will be used.

COURSE OBJECTIVES
The student will be able to:
1. Demonstrate understanding of basic concepts of GIS design and structure including fundamental concepts of cartography and spatial thinking, GIS data structures, base files, measurement, input, storage, editing, output, and display.
2. Demonstrate understanding of the concepts and application of spatial measurement, spatial analysis, classification, network analysis and overlay analysis.
