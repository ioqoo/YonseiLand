This course is to provide you with basic information and analytic skills that you will need for your further legal studies, or, simply just for your life in the future as a citizen of a civilized nation.

Throughout the course, we will explore various topics relating to the law, including the following: What is the law?; What kinds of legal systems are out there around the world?; What kinds of laws do we have?; Who are the relevant actors regarding the law?; What are their roles?; Who makes the law?; When do we need the law?; Who uses the law for what purposes?; Are they applied correctly?; Are they good law?; What is a good law?; and, What is justice? To find out the answers to these questions, we will explore variety of different legal systems including those of Korea, U.S.A., Germany and the UK. 

If you actively engage in this class, upon our successful completion, you will be able:  
-to develop a firm understanding of ‘the definition of the law’, ‘the role of the law’ and ‘the role of different actors regarding the law’; 
-to develop a critical and analytical thinking skill; and
-to develop a balanced and flexible view on the law which is not prejudiced by a specific legal system.
