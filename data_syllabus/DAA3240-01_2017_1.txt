Course Description: Lecture, three hours; discussion, one hour. 
Goals: This course deals a description and fundamentals of the major issues 
and stages of developing in industrial organic materials such as organic 
materials for petroleum industry, information processing, display, and 
biotechnology.  Starting from nomenclatures, bonding and strutures of organic 
chemicals, this course will cover basic principles and mechanism of organic 
chemical reaction, importance of organic chemistry and materials in emerging 
technologies such as organic electronics, energy technology, green technology, 
biotechnology, and sustainable chemical industry.
