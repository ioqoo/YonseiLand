##
This course responds to the need of the Korean society to campaign for 
education reform in order to address social issues that result from the 
increasing multicultural characterization of Korea.  In particular, this course 
is aimed at: (1) helping students recognize and challenge their biases and 
notions of race, culture, language, social justice, and multicultural 
education; (2) increasing the awareness levels of students on the problems and 
opportunities that multiculturalism brings to the society; and (3) empowering 
the students with the capacity to exercise affirmative action and leadership in 
theoretical and practical ways.  The theoretical approach will be done by 
immersing students into schools of thought that help explain 
the `multicultural` state of Korea, while the practical will be done by 
encouraging students to conduct a `community project,` which deals with a 
social issue or phenomenon that relates to both multicuturalism and education 
or multicultural education in Korea. The project prompts the students to 
investigate a problem, project, or program in the community and analyze it 
extensively using a rubric that will be proposed and agreed upon in class.
