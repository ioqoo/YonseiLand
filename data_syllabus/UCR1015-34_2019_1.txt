Students will participate in the `Knit One, Save One` project which is part of a campaign initiated by `Save the Children` to help save lives of children 
under the age of 5 in Africa and Asia. Students are required to knit `at least` 2 baby caps during the semester `in class` and `by themselves`. Students who already know how to knit will lead a group of beginners and make sure that nobody falls behind.  At the end of each class, there will be a progress check. The finished caps will be sent to those in need in Uganda, Ethiopia and Tajikistan.
* This SE course does not provide official volunteer hours. You may sign up for 5  volunteer hours through `Save the Children` after the hats are sent in
(January, 2020).
