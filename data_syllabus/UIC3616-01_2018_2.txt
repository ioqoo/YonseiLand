The goal of this course is to impart basic knowledge of North Korean culture, particularly its literature and film. To that end, this course examines the North Korean regime’s insistence that songs, plays, and folktales produced by Kim Il Sung’s anti-Japanese guerrilla unit―its leader, members, and supporters―during the Japanese occupation of Korea were the matrix of North Korean literature and art. Anything other than the art influenced by the first North Korean leader’s military achievement in the 1930s has been denied or underestimated in discussions of the roots of North Korean art. Through examining North Korean theories and re-examining different aspects of North Korean culture, this course will provide a new perspective on North Korean literature and film. 
After an introduction to the history and the function of North Korean literature and film, the course will explore two topics: the long-term debate over the roots of North Korean literature (Sections B, C, and D); and the late North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il’s role in the formation of North Korea’s national literature and film from the late 1960s until his death in 2011 (Sections E and F). 
All students are expected to participate in class discussions each week. Visual materials and literary texts relate to different themes; secondary readings and more general theoretical texts from a variety of academic disciplines will enrich our discussion. 
The main subjects of this course are two North Korean films: Sea of Blood (1969) and The Flower Girl (1972); and two North Korean novels: The Year 1932 (1973) and Revolutionary Aurora (1973); all of which were produced under Kim Jong Il’s direction.
