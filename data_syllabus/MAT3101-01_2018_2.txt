The course will quickly review the basic of the point-set topology, and once 
we are done about basic topology, we will discuss the most important concepts 
and definitions in elementary topology, mostly concerns the fundamental group. Then we compute those algebraic gadgets on 
surfaces and higher dimensional manifolds.

The course will quickly review the basic of the point-set topology, and once 
we are done about basic topology, we will discuss the most important concepts 
and definitions in elementary topology, mostly concerns the fundamental group 
and (siungular) homology group. Then we compute those algebraic gadgets on 
surfaces and higher dimensional manifolds. A detailed grading scheme is 
announced as above.
