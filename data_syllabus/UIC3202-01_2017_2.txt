Language acquisition is a continuous learning process that relies on the 
proficiency gained in the previous semester. We therefore advise that 
students maintain a letter grade C+ or better, in order to advance to the next level. 
Without this minimum grade, students are likely to perform poorly, if not feel 
lost altogether, and it is not advisable that they advance to the higher level 
of instruction.
