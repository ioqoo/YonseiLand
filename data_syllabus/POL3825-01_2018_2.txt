We will begin by studying the rebuilding of Europe and the stark division of 
the continent following the Second World War, comparing how countries across 
Western Europe embraced varying combinations of liberalism and socialism while 
the ‘Iron Curtain’ sealed Eastern Europe within Communism until that system’
s stunningly peaceful collapse that climaxed in November 1989 with the 
dismantling of the Berlin Wall.  We also will trace the evolution of the 
European Union; despite references to the ‘United States of Europe,’ dating 
back to the earliest visions of European integration, we will study how the 
European Union has been developing on a fundamentally different path from the 
United States of America ? and any other political system, for that matter.
We will pay particular attention to the ongoing debt crisis that has 
threatened the future of the European single currency, and, some say, the 
European Union itself.
