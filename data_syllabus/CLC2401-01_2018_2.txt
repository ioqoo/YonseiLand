We will begin with a brief consideration of what myths are and why they are 
relevant, followed by a survey of representative theories of mythology. Then 
we move on to read classical myths and the cultural elements that gave rise to 
particular myths. When we have examined some of the most significant classical 
myths, we will apply what we have learned in our analyses of "modern" myths, 
beginning with folktales and local legends.
