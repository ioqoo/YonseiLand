외국어를 한국어로 번역하는 훈련을 통해 한국어 번역 숙련도를 높이고 한국어의 특징을 파악하여 추후 한국어 교육에 활용케 하는 것이 목표이다. 초반에는 번역이론을 개괄하고 점진적으로 번역실습을 늘여서 실습결과에 대해 토론하고 번역할 때 고려사항들을 점검한다.

The purpose of this course is to train foreign students to translate from their language(L1) to Korean(L2) and to help them acquire a modicum of knowledge of the Korean language, with the hope that this knowledge will improve their Korean skills for teaching in the classroom. In the first few weeks, we look at theories and issues of translation, together with discussions on actual translations by the students. Just before midterms, students will attempt to write their own translation course syllabi. After midterms, students will devote their time on the term project and learn more about the Korean language as they translate. In tandem, they will also make their own personal translation dictionaries.
