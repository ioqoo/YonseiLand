What is sex? What is gender? What is sexuality? How are these concepts related to culture? To nature? To help you answer these important questions, this course will introduce you to the exciting field of gender, sexuality, and women’s studies. This course introduces short stories by women in England and America. This course looks at fiction and some nonfiction by women writers of varying ethnic, class, racial, and sexual backgrounds and includes critical contemporary discussion of women and gender. This course begins by asking the question “What is Women’s Literature” and proceeds through a variety of readings in an attempt to expose you to the gamut of women’s lives and concerns as represented in literature. This class will examine the changing perspectives (or not) of women writers from the 19th century to present day. To this end, you will be reading selections focused around a theme or idea represented in women’s literature from different historical periods. Our class meetings will include discussions about the readings, in which we will consider content, form, historical period, and the relationship among the readings. Through our discussions of the reading, we will consider issues of race, class, gender, sexuality, and artistic expression.
