This course examines the development of America from its colonial foundations 
to the 20th Century. It provides an introduction to the major themes of American 
history: territorial expansion, racial strife, political development, and 
economic growth. We shall consider in particular the question of conflict and 
cohesion in the historical evolution of the American nation and society: how 
United were the American People and their States throughout History?

Students will develop their research, writing and oral presentation skills 
over the semester.  They will become familiar with the primary sources most 
commonly used by historians of the United States, learn to distinguish them 
from secondary sources, and develop their ability to analyze both types of 
sources in constructing persuasive historical arguments. By the end of the 
semester you will have attained the ability to think critically about 
historical questions that are of profound significance for making sense of the 
modern world order through a detailed understanding of American history.
