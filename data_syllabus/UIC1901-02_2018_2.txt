Human existent has always been technological existence: we can barely even begin to think of what it might mean to be human outside of our relation to the tools we use, from the simplest wooden implements to the most advanced information technologies. And yet the extraordinarily rapid evolution of technology, especially in the last 200 years, suggests that if human existence is technological existence, then what it means to be human is not only itself rapidly changing, but indeed subject to a dangerous uncertainty. 
The aim of this class is to offer a survey of the complex philosophical issues that technology involves. Some questions we will be asking include: what is the relation between technology and human history? Is history determined by technological evolution? What is the specific difference between `modern technologies,` such as computers and electronic mass media, and `traditional` technology? Does technology pose a threat to human dignity? What are the social implications of technological developments?
