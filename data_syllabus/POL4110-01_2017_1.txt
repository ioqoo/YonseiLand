The Kim Jong-un regime in North Korea triggered world wide concerns not only 
for South Korea but also surrounding countries of the Korean peninsula. It is a transcient period of a country that possesses nuclear weapons.  North Korea has successfully confronted the United States for more than twenty years and it conducted nuclear tests in spite of repeated warnings from the George W. Bush administration and China. And now, they seemed to be successful to realize unprecedented three-generation succession from Kim Il Sung to Kim Jong-il and then to Kim Jong-un. This course is designed to illuminate what is the source of North Korea`s provocative diplomacy vis-a-vis the United States, what are their logics and how to solve the nuclear issue.
