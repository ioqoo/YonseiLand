In this class, students learn how individuals (consumers and firms) make their choices and how they interact in markets. Consumers demand many kinds of products and want to maximize their utilities (= happiness) subject to budget constraints. Firms supply many kinds of products and want to maximize their profits. When they interact in a market, the equilibrium price is determined to equate their demands and supplies. We will study these topics in detail throughout this semester.
