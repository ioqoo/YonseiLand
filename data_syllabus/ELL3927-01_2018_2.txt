This course surveys dramatic works of Christopher Marlowe and his contemporaries. We’ll begin the course with Christopher Marlowe by reading The Jew of Malta, a tragic farce, and Edward II, the only history play Marlowe left us. With the Marlovian representations of strangers and Others, we’ll explore early modern discourses of anti-Semitism and homosexuality. City comedy was one of the most prominent subgenres of English Renaissance drama exploring metropolitan London’s spatial construction. By reading Thomas Dekker’s Shoemaker’s Holiday, we’ll study the conventions of city comedies along with multiculturalism and metropolitanism the play illustrates. Toward the end of semester, we’ll read Shakespeare’s Hamlet as a discursive echo chamber of the English Reformation and Counter-Reformation.
