Capitalism need not lead to huge inequalities. But in almost all capitalist economies we see shocking levels of inequality in wealth and income. How and why does this happen? What are the consequences of such immense inequality ? not just for democracy, but also for individual life choices? 

To get some purchase on these questions we begin with a frank look at the life, ethos, and career strategies of university students and workers in contemporary South Korea / East Asia. We then turn to examine some key issues in the history of capitalism: how certain policies increased inequality, and how those policies were justified. 

In the second half of the course we consider the historical context within which Korean capitalism emerged, and the particularities of the developmental state. We end with the question, What is to be done? Here, we will look at how some neoliberal ideas may serve progressive ends, and what (real) freedom might feel like. Background in economic theory is not necessary.
