The main idea of the course is to introduce students with the concept of science as a special way of thinking, and the concept of the nature of science. We point out how science in western traditions has developed over the centuries. We explain how and why scientific and technological achievements were possible and what led to them. We try to answer many questions about our universe, the beginning of life, evolution and the DNA, human brain and mind, but ultimately these answers lead us more unanswered questions. By the end of the course we will see how the scientific paradigm has been changed throughout the intellectual human history. We combine some scientific fields into content blocks in order to represent the picture of the world and our perceptions about it.
