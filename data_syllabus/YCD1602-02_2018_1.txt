COURSE DESCRIPTION: 
Popular music is an integral part of contemporary life. We not only love/hate popular music but also understand the social world and ourselves through it. The course aims to understand popular music, not as isolated artistic texts, but situated within the social and cultural context. The first part of the course introduces key concepts and theories for the understanding of popular music as a socio-economic phenomenon and a cultural-political expression. We ask and try to answer a series of questions. For instance: By what industrial and technological processes does popular music reach us? What are we actually doing when we consume popular music? How does popular music make us? The second part of the course surveys the historical development of Korean popular music from yuhaengga in the colonial era up until k-pop today. We look at a variety of musical genres and styles which emerged and developed in modern Korea by situating them within a wider historical context of Korean politics and culture.
