1)Course Description
This course provides an in-depth overview of human physiology with special emphasis on relationships to both normal human function and dysfunction. This course consists of learning how human body system organized and interconnected to control physiological function. I covered the basic information on anatomical structures that are clinical importance. Each lecture is interrelated and contain huge amount of knowledge to memorize and understand.I had a time to summarize each lecture every time and ask questions about lecture. I evaluated students based on how they understand body system in terms of whole system.
