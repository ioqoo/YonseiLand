The goal of this course is learning the basic process of product design such as background research, idea sketch, CAD modelling (Rhino 3D) and prototype making. Each student will design and build an IoT product prototype as a final result of this course. In addition to the basic product design process training, this course will also be a chance to think about the utilitarian, aesthetic and semantic aspects of product design.
