Knowledge is not produced solely by the pursuit of discovering absolute truth. Production and consumption of knowledge is socially embedded, and therefore cannot be politically, culturally and socially neutral. 
This course explores 1) how legitimacy and validity is attached to and detached from knowledge under the specific social contexts, 2) how accessibility to knowledge is allowed and denied to different social groups, 3) how knowledge is accepted and rejected by the public, and 4) how we can ensure democratically accountable production and consumption of knowledge. 
In addition to classic literature in the sociology of knowledge, this course also deals with new challenges and promises brought by the new media in the digital age.
