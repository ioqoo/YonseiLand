This course will provide a broad overview of Christianity, both Catholicism and Protestantism, in Korea, mainly focusing on its introduction, reactions
from traditional Confucian Korean society, and the roles played by Western missionaries, particularly their contributions to the nation`s modernization. 
Korea has one of the most diverse and dynamic religious cultures of any nation in the world today. However, Korea also witnessed a very turbulent 
history in building a modern democratic nation-state. In this context, Korean Christian Churches and Christians have made great contributions to 
developing their nation, ranging from participating in independence movements and democratizations to developing women`s education and social 
status. Starting from the encounters between Choson and the Jesuits, this course will survey how Catholicism and Protestantism have influenced 
Korea and what challenges they are facing now. Lastly, this course will examine the history of Yonsei University and Severance Hospital as 
illustrative examples of the contributions the Western missionaries have made to Korean education and medicine.
