This course explores the role of the United States in the world from its 
founding until the present day.  The first half of the course traces United 
States global policy from the American Revolution to superpower status in the 
20th century to all the unresolved issues and anxieties of the present day, 
including a rising China, a resurgent Russia and the emergence of the Islamic 
State.  Then we take a thematic approach in examining numerous key issues and 
debates regarding the role of the United States in the world.  We also will 
situate United States global policy in the context of broader theoretical 
models that seek to explain the field of international relations.   We will 
examine ongoing events in the news, as developments emerge, and relate current 
issues and policy choices to lessons learned in the past.
