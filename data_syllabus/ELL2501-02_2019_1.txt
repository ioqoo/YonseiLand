This course explores the use of language to express human truths and emotions, 
from love and sorrow, politics and conflict, to family relations and individual identities. 
We will be reading a range of works in English literature, grouped into poetry, fiction, 
and drama, in order to understand how authors have expressed their most private 
and public views through the written word. This course also serves as an introduction 
to core concepts and tools in the reading and analysis of English literature, and an 
introduction to thinking, speaking, and writing about literature in English.
