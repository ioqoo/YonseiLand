PLEASE BE AWARE, to complete this class you MUST attend the special evening lectures with the visiting Shinhan Professor during the weeks of April 13-26.

Logic is often defined as the science of good reasoning. It is said to be intimately connected with our ability to think, express ourselves, understanding others, and attain knowledge of how the world works. In this class, we are going to examine the relationships between logic, truth, and paradox. We will tackle questions like: How does logic relate to good reasoning? Do sentences have ’logical forms’ and is this somehow built in to language? What is truth and what does it have to do with logical validity? Can we solve paradoxes by a judicious use of logic? What does it mean to revise a logical theory? Our goal is not to answer these questions once and for all, it is simply to have interesting discussions about these issues with a leading expert in the field of logic, Professor Jc Beall of the University of Connecticut.
