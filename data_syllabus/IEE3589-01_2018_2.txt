The course aims to provide students with an understanding of sustainable development and interdependence of societal systems at diverse levels; making and managing of environmental regulations and policies, the globalized production-consumption system, and values and behaviors of individuals. The lectures and reading materials explain key concepts in the discourse of sustainability, and take an actor-centric approach to environmental governance. 

Upon completion of this course, students are expected to identify current issues in environmental governance, discuss and apply key concepts to real life challenges, and formulate evidence-based arguments to apply critical thinking to case analysis.

The environmental impacts of economic activities and resource-rich lifestyles do not affect scientists and regulators only. Climate change, fine dust, and health problems derived from chemicals and hazardous wastes are everyday concern to average individuals. Though the phenomenon of environmental problems can be observed relatively easily, the difficulty lies in the fact that the mechanism of environmental derogation involves complex causalities. The efforts to resolve or mitigate environmental problems have failed when stakeholders with different interests cannot reach a consensus, while uncertainties embedded in the analysis and projection of environmental impacts are used both to advocate and discourage measures to deal with this grave challenge.
This course starts with the status quo understanding of environmental problems for each issue area and behavioral dimension including bounded rationality that lead to such failures. It goes on to discuss the notion of sustainability and interaction of societal subsystems to address the problems. Perspectives from science and technology as well as from management and governance are examined to achieve sustainability to ensure wellbeing of humans in the present and in the future. Roles of actors and institutions at different levels - such as IGOs, governments, civil society, media, private sector, partnerships, regimes, etc. - should be understood in details for the needed changes for environmental governance and sustainable development. The class concludes with deliberations and suggestions for sustainability transition.
