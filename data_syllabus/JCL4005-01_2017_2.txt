This course provides an introduction to the basic information relating to the contract laws around the world. For such goal, we will focus our review on one of the most very widely accepted international treaties regarding the contract law, namely, the United Nations Convention on the Contract for the International Sale of Goods(the “CISG”). By reviewing the CISG and sometimes comparing it with domestic laws and other international instruments regarding contracts, we will be able to understand the basic structure of the contract laws with some international perspectives.

First, we will start by examining the meaning and importance of basic concepts such as transaction, international transaction, contract, law and treaty. Based on such understanding, we will move on to the CISG, an international treaty governing a specific kind of contractual relationship, that is, the contractual relationship between the buyer and the seller of the “goods”. By doing so, we will be able to answer the following questions at the end of the semester: What is “law”?; What is contract law?; How is an international transaction different from a domestic transaction?; What are the laws made specifically for the international transactions?; What is the CISG?; When does it apply?; What does it do, if applied?; What specific rules does the CISG contain?; and, How different are they from typical domestic ones?
