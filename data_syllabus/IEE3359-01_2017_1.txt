##
This course is an introductory survey of the development of Korean society 
throughout the modern era. The class begins with an examination of the social 
structure at the end of the Chos≈çn dynasty (1392-1910) and the transformation 
of Korean society through the colonial period (1910-1945), post-Liberation 
division and war (1945-1953), and contemporary society to the present. We will 
examine the history and processes of social transformation, focusing on the 
unique historical, political, social, and economic situation of Korea, but 
within a larger East Asian and global context. Specifically, students will 
examine the evolution of Korean society through internally and externally 
imposed changes as the rise of the modern nation-state converged with the 
penetration of foreign political influence and the global world economy.
