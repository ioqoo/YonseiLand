In this class, basic theories of the fundamental materials science and 
characterization tools are to be discussed. In addition, recent progresses in 
materials science will be overviewed. The objective of this course is learning 
the fundamentals on the materials science which will be applicable for 
materials industry and researches. To develop novel materials, 
knowledge on the biology, organic, and inorganic chemistry is required. 
Therefore learning on these basic sciences is important in materials research. 
In detail, molecular interaction, crystalline structure, mechanical, optical, 
magnetic, and electronic properties of materials, characterization tools, and 
recent topics on the materials research will be the scope of this course.
