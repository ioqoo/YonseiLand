The subtitle of this course is “The Rise of the Modern Novel and the Rise of the Modern Self.” As the title implies, this course examines the emergence and establishment of the British modern novel in relation to the birth and development of the idea of an individual self. Reading representative British novels written from mid-18th to early 19th century, we will study the generic features of the modern novel, historical background that brought about the new literary form and the co-relation of the novel genre with the idea of a modern self.
