This course is designed to develop a deep appreciation for all aspects of Neorealist theory (primarily but not exclusively the theory of Kenneth Waltz) by studying how the theoretical concepts relate to real world questions that are of interest to the class. After 3 initial lectures by the professor, EVERY aspect of the class will be handled by the students themselves. The professor`s role will be limited as much as possible to providing feedback outside of the class discussion.
