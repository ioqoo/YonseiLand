This course is the sequel to Cultural Criticism and Writing (KOR 3330-01). It is an expository writing intensive course designed specifically for students 
in the Department of Korean Language and Literature. The rubrics have been set at a specific level to accommodate the students in the department 
who need to improve certain areas in their writing. This course is designed to help students to develop the ability to produce clear expository prose. 
Native speakers or those with a high English fluency will be asked to drop the first day of class. Can video games offer the same depth of characters and insight into the human condition as a novel?  Students will examine the relationship between literature and video games by exploring various theories from literary criticism to postmodernism and cinema studies, new approaches to visuality and play, and reading/playing video games that take on 
sophisticated literary qualities, to understand the unique structures of interactive narratives and their effects on those who play them. Upon completion of the course, students should be able to not only produce cogent, well-developed essays using standard written English, but also have developed a 
capacity for critical and creative thinking and a deeply profound appreciation for games/literature.
