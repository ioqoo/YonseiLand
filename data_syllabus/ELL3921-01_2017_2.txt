The English-speaking cultures scattered all around the globe have been created by those who have read, honoured, or at least carried the English Bible. The sacred Book was read as a literal and popular authority in Britain and her colonies on moral, spiritual and existential questions of good and evil, self and society, life and death for some four centuries from the Reformation to World War II (and in parts of US, even to this very moment). The Bible had also served as a foremost reference book on a wide range of earthly issues of law, politics, diplomacy, economics, and science. Yet it also stood behind some of the greatest monuments of English literature, some of whom, such as [The Pilgrimâ€™s Progress], exercised a huge emotional and spiritual power over its readers supplementing or even competing with the Bible itself. This course explores and celebrates the unique importance of the English Bible, in particular, the King James Bible (King James Version, as it is called in the US) by reading parts of the Bible and a select list of masterpieces of English literature that have close relationship to it.
