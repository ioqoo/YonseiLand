UIC and other Yonsei students (if permitted by  UIC office) who are interested in comparative literature, ancient history, religious studies, 
mythology and ancient languages in regards to the Hebrew Bible(Old Testament). This course will explore the classic world, so called ANE, 
Ancient Near East (Mesopotamia, Egypt, Anatolia and Biblical Israel) as reflected in recorded inscriptions. In order for you to genuinely 
enjoy this class, you are expected to be interested in some basic knowledge of the Bible, but not necessarily so. If you wish to peep into the 
very origin of human intellect, mythic worlds, and the VERY roots of both the western/eastern civilizations, you are strongly invited to take this course; 
in Ancient Near East our human civilization began!
