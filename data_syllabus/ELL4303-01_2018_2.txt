Nineteenth-century British literature is populated with distressed children. Poor, orphaned, disabled, and homeless children saturated literary and non-literary texts during this period and people read stories about suffering children with unprecedented curiosity and philanthropic zeal to alleviate their sufferings. Reading nineteenth-century British novels, parliament reports, pamphlets and (auto)biographies that deal with childhood distress, this course examines the socio-historical background that facilitated this sudden boost of interest in afflicted children. We will explore the role of child victim figures in nineteenth-century British cultural imagination and inquiry into its legacy in our own time.
