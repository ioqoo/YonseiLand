Linear algebra opens the door to higher mathematics, science, and technology. 
This course emphasizes skills, theory, and applications: 
*The major goals of MAT3120 (Linear Algebra 1, 2) are:
?To develop a systematic knowledge of the elements of linear algebra: (Three 
main emphases of Linear Algebra,  Fields and Vector spaces, Linear Operators, 
Determinants and eigenvalues, The Jordan canonical form), Orthogonality and 
its most important application of best approximation, The spectral theory of 
symmetric matrices and Hermitian matrices, The singular value decomposition, 
Matrix factorizations and numerical linear algebra, Infinite dimensional 
vector spaces and Analysis in vector spaces.
?To develop students` skills and strategies for mathematical investigation 
and problem solving; 
?To see how all these play a key role in many practical applications in 
today`s technological society; Various applications of linear algebra show how 
linear algebra is essential not only in solving problems involving algebra, 
geometry, differential equations, optimization, approximation, combinatorics, 
but also in the fields such as biology, economics, computer graphics, 
electrical engineering, cryptography, political science as well as sciences.  
*We present the core of the linear algebra as an axiomatic development of the 
most important elements of finite-dimensional linear algebra and progress into 
more abstract areas as we add structure to our knowledge: Fields and Vector 
spaces, Linear Operators, Determinants and eigenvalues, The Jordan canonical 
form, Orthogonality and its most important application of best approximation, 
The spectral theory of symmetric matrices and Hermitian matrices, The singular 
value decomposition, Matrix factorizations and numerical linear algebra, 
Infinite dimensional vector spaces and Analysis in vector spaces.
