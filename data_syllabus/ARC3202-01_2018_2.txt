The physical significance of material properties in structural engineering is 
explained. Constitutive equation for the relationship between force and 
deformation is discusssed along with important material properties such as 
Young`s Modulus and Poisson`s Ratio. In the laboratory, the properties of 
steel and concrete are measured. Team projects are assigned to use advanced 
testing equipments such as ultrasonic testing machines and wireless 
sensor systems.
