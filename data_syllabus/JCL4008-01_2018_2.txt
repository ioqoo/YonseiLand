Punishment--defined broadly as the taking of some corrective action in response to an offense--is a staple of every society. It plays an important role in politics, business transactions, criminal justice, the education system, families, our personal relationships, and even in social media interactions. This course will examine the four major components of punishment--incapacitation, rehabilitation, deterrence, and retribution--analyzing them for moral justification and practical effectiveness in the variety of realms where punishment is employed. Although the justification for punishment is to enforce norms and hold society together, we will explore the many ways in which punishment as typically practiced actually drives us apart, and explore more effective ways to deal with transgression in both formal and informal settings, drawing on philosophy, psychology, law, game theory, and case studies along the way.

Target knowledge and skills to be developed:

- Understanding of the core justifications and methods of punishment
- Understanding the basis for making ethical and policy decisions
- Ethical and policy analysis
- Critical thinking and debate skills
- Clear and effective persuasive writing
