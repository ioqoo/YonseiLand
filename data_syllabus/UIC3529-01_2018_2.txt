"Dramatic Arts in the Digital Age": In this course, we will explore a variety of dramatic arts (theatrical, cinematic, alternative) through screen/play-writing, collage, filmic and
musical (film-scoring) composition. Part I of the course will be devoted to initial explorations, reflections on and discussion of what occurs in these fields of composition as they shift from analog to digital. During Part II, we will continue our practice in the dramatic arts while studying and applying the theory and narrative structures explicated in Professor Mike Figgis` book The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations. The final two weeks of the course will be devoted to digital filmmaking (with Professor Figgis` eponymous text as our guide), as we engage in discussion, workshop, and collaboration with Professor Figgis.
