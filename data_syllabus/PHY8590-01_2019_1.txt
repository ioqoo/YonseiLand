This course will cover the fundamental principles of laser operations, and 
then discuss specific laser systems. The goal is to equip students with the 
basic knowledge necessary to understand and use various lasers in their 
research and/or engineering careers.  Therefore, the first half of the course 
will be very theoretical. Although this is a quickly changing industry, 
teaching the fundamentals will allow students to understand new technological 
developments as they occur. During the second half we will cover specific 
lasers systems and their applications. While we will cover the standard lasers 
used in physics, chemistry and biologicallabs and their pulsed operations.
