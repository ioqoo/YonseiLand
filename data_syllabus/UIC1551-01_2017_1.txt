How did the small island of Britain become a world power and what were its interactions with the world? What are the legacies of these interactions today? The aim of this course is to provide students with the opportunity to explore such questions by learning about and engaging with a variety of historical sources. 

This course combines lectures and discussions with the aim of helping students to develop historical skills that are transferable in other areas. By studying this broad and expansive theme in world history we will explore a variety of subjects and debates of enduring significance, such as the relationship between elite and mass politics, imperialism and national sovereignty, and between scientific and non-scientific views of the world. 

The class is organized in a broadly chronological way and the emphasis will be on building and developing skills through content-based classwork and writing. My hope is that by the end of the course, students will have acquired a set of historical skills that they can select and apply independently, and which will translate into other fields, both in college and professionally.
