This course studies the cellular initiation and construction of mammalian organisms.  
The major models of amniote and mammalian developmental biology are used to facilitate the study of early development (cleavage, gastrulation, and axis formation), building with ectoderm (the vertebrate nervous system and epidermis), and building with mesoderm and endoderm (organogenesis).
