This course takes an integrated skills approach. Class time should focus on the productive skill of speaking with some listening skills and strategies taught explicitly. However,
 the majority of the listening activities and strategy reinforcement should be performed outside of class.Students are expected to actively participate in pair and small group 
activities. The instructors should monitor individual performance in terms of vocabulary, accuracy, and pronunciation in order to provide regular feedback. Students will be 
given a weekly listening , a weekly discussion question and a bi weekly mini presentation. Students will gain confidence functioning in an academic English-speaking 
environment. They will be exposed to authentic listening materials such as news or lectures. By participating in group discussions and oral projects, students will develop their
