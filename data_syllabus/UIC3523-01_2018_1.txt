Sigmund Freud: Reading "Love" through Master Texts

In this (excitingly!) fast-paced course, we will survey some of the most widely read works of Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), the founder of psychoanalysis as a scientific-humanistic theory and a clinical practice. We will pay particular attention to the concept of love that emerges through Freud`s writings, from such profound and scandalous concepts as "infantile sexuality," "transference," and "death drive." No prior knowledge of psychoanalysis is presumed. To complete the course successfully, students should be willing to deal thoughtfully with complex concepts presented in the reading material, which they will synthesize towards their own "theories" of love.
