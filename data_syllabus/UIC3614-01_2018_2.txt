This course is designed to give students an understanding of the philosophical and institutional ‘operating system’ of the United States. By learning about how the country is supposed to operate, we can better understand the processes by which the US government acts, including how ideas become policies and the structural limitations on the executive branch. This will give us a better understanding of how the US is able to act in international relations, and how domestic policies (e.g. trade or human rights) that can affect the rest of the world are shaped.
The course will be conducted collaboratively with universities in the United States, and students at Yonsei will interact with students from those universities in online discussions as part of their assessment.
