As the possibilities of individual and collective life flounder spectacularly under the pressures of modernity (increasing rate of environmental catastrophe, ceaseless state violence, the crisis of liberal democratic civility and the renewed rise of the far right ? to name just a few cheery examples), this class turns to contemporary literature and scholarship that interrogate just what possibilities remain. What terms are produced to describe the linguistic, temporal and spatial conditions of the present? What modes of subjectivity are still available? How hopeful or disenchanted should we be?

We will begin with recent critiques of education, labor, and global development, moving on to key political theories about how society should be organized. Might economic rationality itself be a fiction of sorts, one whose narrative structure and conceptions of the human agent have taken a powerful hold on our imagination? What new fictions of political economy must thus be scripted? We will also attend to the dimensions of affect so central to recent discourse, i.e. how feelings both construct and resist contemporary politics. Finally, we will read some sublime and visionary literary works that imagine history beyond the “Anthropocene.”

We will create and maintain a blog on which everyone will post their thoughts on a weekly basis. The blog entries are free in form, aimed at getting you to produce a genuine response to the texts and issues at hand. Consider it a public journal of sorts. You will also conduct research throughout the semester to produce an extended thesis with multiple secondary sources. At the end of the semester, we will hold a "conference" in which everyone will present their research.
