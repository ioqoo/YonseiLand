This course touches upon various contemporary issues in East Asia and makes students to think through history and cultural dynamics. 
This semester, we would like to emphasize 3 themes. 
1. Nationalism and Gender--the history of the development of feminist ideas in Asia, and how  women were involved in wartime efforts, especially, the predicaments of modern girls and new women in colonial period. Compare Japan and Korea.
2. Culture and Politics in colonial and postcolonial times--What is "justice"? What were the everyday life of colonial times like, and how do we imagine them in contemporary setting? 
3. Cold War in Asia from a comparative perspective
