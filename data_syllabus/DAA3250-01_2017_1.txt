This course will cover basic concepts and definitions in thermodynamics, the 
first law of thermodynamics, properties of real and ideal gases, heat eff 
ects, the second and third laws of thermodynamics and thermodynamic 
relationships. 
After taking this course, students should be able to:
- Understand the basic definitions and the development of the first law of 
thermodynamics;
- Display knowledge of pressure/volume/temperature behaviour of fluids and 
certain heat effects;
- Apply the first law to evaluate engineering problems;
- Understand the implications of the second law of thermodynamics;
- Demonstrate comprehension of procedures for estimating thermodynamic 
properties under various process conditions
