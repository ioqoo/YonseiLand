This advanced English level three-credit course is designed to improve all four English skills: reading, writing, listening and 
speaking and to simulate studying a course in a foreign English-speaking nation. The course is divided into two parts: self-empathy and other-empathy. Progress in course will enhance your confidence and autonomy when using English. Rather than being a lecture course in which the professor speaks and the students take notes, the course will focus on the students as interactive, cross-cultural, independent and critical thinkers, concerned citizens, and eventual conflict mediators. The information presented is dense and the workload will be heavy and challenging, and students are expected to prepare for each class in advance.
