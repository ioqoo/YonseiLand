How can we communicate meaningfully and persuasively in an age awash with 
information, where “Google” has become a verb synonymous with finding 
answers?  Everyone has access to the same pool of knowledge, so the ability to 
choose, frame, and explain cogent knowledge becomes even more critical and 
valuable. This special ability is storytelling. Although human beings are 
hardwired to understand and make sense of the world through stories, not 
everyone is a born storyteller, even in one`s own native language. Luckily, 
storytelling is a skill that can be learned and improved with practice. By 
studying how stories work and honing our storytelling skills, we can increase 
the impact of our communication. In this course, we will learn to frame and 
tell compelling stories about organizations both orally and visually as well 
as to tell the most important story of them all: our own.
