How can you talk about the poor child without addressing the country that let her be so? It’s a relatively new way of thinking for me. I was raised to put all responsibility on the individual, on the bootstraps with which she ought pull herself up. But it’s the way of things that environment changes outcomes…  
- Smarsh, Sarah. (2018) Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth. 

Capitalism need not lead to huge inequalities. But in almost all capitalist economies we see shocking levels of inequality in wealth and income. How and why does this happen? What are the consequences of such immense inequality ? for democracy and for individual life choices? 

A compelling examination of these questions requires historical and international comparisons. We will look at wealth and income inequalities over time and across national boundaries, and we will listen to those who speak clearly and powerfully about the life and circumstances of the poor in three democracies: United States, India, and South Korea. 

When we focus on South Korea, we must consider shifts in the post-WW II history of American empire, along with the violence of post-war South Korean history of developmentalism and neo-liberalism. We will consider how certain policies and practices allowed for increasing inequality as well as economic growth, and how those policies were justified & naturalized. 

We will end with consideration of how some neoliberal ideas may serve progressive ends. Background in economic theory is not necessary.
