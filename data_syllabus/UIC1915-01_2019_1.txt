Course Description:
What we now considered “literature,” literary masterpieces, and canonical works of literature are by no means self-evident. This course will look at how “world literature,” far from its neutralized, idealized definition ? a cosmopolitan literature that bypasses national boundaries, but is rather reflective of the “world” is mediated through institutions such as the physical spaces of the library, canonized lists of “great books,” digital archives, book fairs, literary festivals, even distinctions such as literary awards/prizes and the politics that underlie them. Further, we will reflect on how the transformations in the way we read over time with the advent of new media technologies, and our increasingly globalizing world affects what we take to be “literature” as well as its ‘worldliness.’ How has the role of the author changed from the nineteenth-century, when “world literature” was first coined as a term by the German writers Wieland and Goethe, to today with the advent of privately-funded, massive literary festivals all over Asia and the pressure faced by contemporary authors of self-marketing on social media? What is the history of “world literature” and its establishment as an institution? Readings will be about 50-60 pages a week at maximum.
Course Goals:
Engage with a variety of methods available to comparative literature, cultural theory, and media studies for analyzing literature and reflect on the many ways of reading them beyond traditional close reading or narratology.  
Develop the ability to read analytically, build arguments, and use innovative methods and frameworks to present your ideas in academic essays. You will acquire these abilities through peer-review, class discussion, oral presentations and active participation in the discussion forum.
