This course will teach you about the importance of the interaction design/human 
computer interaction in the design and development of computationally-enabled 
devices that people use. We will touch on many of the perceptual, cognitive, 
and social characteristics of people, as well as methods for understanding more 
about your users. After learning methods of design, implementation, and 
evaluation, you will have an opportunity to apply your skills and knowledge in 
a team project, by going through the various stages of an effective design 
process.
