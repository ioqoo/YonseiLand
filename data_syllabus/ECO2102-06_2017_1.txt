Microeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of 
individual households and firms in making decisions on the allocation of 
limited resources. Typically, it applies to markets where goods or services 
are bought and sold. Microeconomics examines how these decisions and behaviors 
affect the supply and demand for goods and services, which determines prices, 
and how prices, in turn, determine the quantity supplied and quantity demanded 
of goods and services.
One of the goals of microeconomics is to analyze market mechanisms that 
establish relative prices amongst goods and services and allocation of limited 
resources amongst many alternative uses. Microeconomics analyzes market 
failure, where markets fail to produce efficient results, and describes the 
theoretical conditions needed for perfect competition. Significant fields of 
study in microeconomics include general equilibrium, markets under asymmetric 
information, choice under uncertainty and economic applications of game 
theory. Also considered is the elasticity of products within the market system.
