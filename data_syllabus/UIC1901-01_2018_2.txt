The 17th and 18th centuries have sometimes been described as a period of intellectual chaos. This is nowhere better illustrated than in the philosophy developed during this time, including by Descartes, Hobbes, Locke and Hume. These philosophers and their contemporaries launched what is now considered the modern period of philosophy, which has had a continuing influence on everything from our understanding of politics, science and ourselves. In this course we will read the seminal works of these important thinkers, with a special focus on the nature of mind, free will, the existence of God, as well as how to ideally socially organize and improve our political lives.
