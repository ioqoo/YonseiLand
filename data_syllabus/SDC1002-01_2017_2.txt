This is an introductory course that is divided into two parts: historial
and theoretical. We will start the course with theories of international 
relations with special emphasis on the traditional approaches to the study of 
power, ideology, state interest, and war and peace. The second part
closely examines the twentieth century history of international relations, 
especially in the Third World. The main objectives of the course are to 
provide 
students with a useful set of analytical tools, a broad understanding of 
different approaches to the study of international relations, and historical 
context to major contemporary issues in world politics
