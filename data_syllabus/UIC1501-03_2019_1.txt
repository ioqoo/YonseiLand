Interest in Central Asian history has grown in recent times due to the US-led incursion into Afghanistan, the growth of independence movements in 
East Turkistan and Tibet and the distribution of energy resources across Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Siberia. This course provides students with a foundation in the political, 
social, and literary history of Central Asia during the Middle Ages (582-1368) when Eurasia was dominated by nomadic empires based in the territory between Iran and 
Mongolia. Particular emphasis will be placed on the themes of cultural interaction, state-formation and world systems as we cover the rise and fall of the Great Turk, Seljuq,
and Mongol Empires. Students who take this course will benefit from directed reading of primary source materials to gain a firm grounding in the history of Central Asia and to improve their analytical reading skills. 

Learning Outcomes
This course is intended to advance the studentsâ€™ understanding of global processes, to improve their ability to conduct independent research, to read both primary sources and modern sources critically, and to develop critical thinking and reasoning skills in a historical context. Having completed this course students will be able to:
- Demonstrate an understanding of key themes in the study of Central Asian history
- Analyse and explicate major ideas associated with the history of Central Asia
- Use period sources to reconstruct attitudes, beliefs and arguments from the past.
- Construct evidence-based arguments about the legacy of important events in Central Asian history.
