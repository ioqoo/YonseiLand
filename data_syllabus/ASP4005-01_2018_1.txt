This research seminar is specifically designed for students who wish to work on their own research project on East Asia within a structured setting. To better identify and critically engage with problems pertinent to East Asia today, the first part of the course examines theories, methods, and case studies that have contributed to shape new debates and approaches in the humanities and social sciences. We will closely study and discuss the texts to identify the ways in which these scholars have challenged the previous scholarship, addressed questions, and demonstrated original ways to approach their objects of study. By doing so, students are expected to become able to self-critically examine their own interests and to identify new problems and/or formulate new questions by the time they start writing their own research project.
