Christianity has significantly contributed to the development of the world’s culture. However, this would not have been possible without Christianity’s interaction with Western philosophy. Philosophy has been the apex of culture in the Western and the non-Western world. Thus we will attempt to foster a critical understanding of the Christian ideas and their relation to the history of Western philosophy in this course.

As for world culture, this course is specifically concerned with pop culture, especially films and music videos. Films and M/Vs represent the spirit of contemporary world culture. As they are the syntheses of religious and philosophical ideas, an analytical approach to them will be attempted.

In so doing, students will be expected to investigate the history of early, medieval, and modern Christianity and Christian theology, to learn about Christianity’s influence on world culture in terms of the interplay between religion and philosophy, and to come to their own understanding of the implications of Christianity in contemporary postmodern society and popular culture.
