My original title for the course was `Monotheism in post modern world.` As indicated, the course aims to unearth the wisdom of Monotheism, in order to deal with post 9/11 world. The world we live in at the present age is marked by a new species of conflict unseen before; ideology has long been replaced by seemingly looming confrontation of so called civilizations (S. Huntington), and further widening gab of wealth among economic players, to name a few. There have been many courses dealing with the prevalent global issues, but  all too few about `how to deal with the underlying issues behind the scene; moral and spiritual ones. The real isssues are about philosophy, ethics, morals and spiritual aspects quintessentially. The course will attemt to initiate a conversation with  philosophical and moral foundations of modern day conflicting issues by inviting the conventional ideas drawn from wellspring of Biblical literature.
