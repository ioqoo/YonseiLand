This class is designed to be a discussion based course.  The goals is to create a dynamic class discussion in which students engage with each other and learn to engage in productive discussion.  The central theme of the course will be ways in which private industry distort scientific research and the extent to which industry-funded science can be relied upon.  There will be NO EXAMS.  Instead, students are expected to come to class each week prepared to engage in discussion.  Grading will be based on in-class discussion and on three small papers that require students to demonstrate an understanding of the material.  Students must keep pace with the weekly readings to do well in this course.  Students who typically do not keep up with course readings or typically only read them as they “cram” for an exam, should understand that such strategies will likely lead to a failing grade. Students must complete an average of 40 pages of reading each week to pass this course.
