##
This course is an introduction to solid state physics and electronic devices 
for undergraduate students. It begins with the electrical and structural 
properties of Si & GaAs and extends to the operation of transistors. This sets 
the stages for the lithography, oxidation, and metallization process steps 
that are required for transistors and interconnections. Then p-n junction and 
field-effect transistor will be discussed.
