This course introduces the concepts and principles of "Heat and Mass Transfer", which are a mode of energy transport and thus, an extension of thermodynamics.
The heat and mass transfer processes are vital for chemical engineering applications and play key a role in all manners of energy conversion and utilization systems,
as well as in biomedical and electronic industries.

This course is focused on to teach principles of heat and mass transfer and learn how to solve its problems for chemical engineering application. 
General modes of heat and mass transfer will be lectured, and both steady-state and transient flows are taught. 

Students taking this course is highly expected to 
 - understand the concept associated with heat and mass transport phenomena
 - rationalize transport modes and states in chemical process and system 
 - be able to setup models and utilize computational simulations to study real chemical processes and systems 

To help the class TA will guide recitations with working example problems. 
Each student is required to complete a team project of computational simulations showing how to calculate solutions to the problems of heat and mass transport with varying 
boundary conditions and systems.
