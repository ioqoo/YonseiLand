The major objective of this course is to teach you how to solve problems using 
algorithmic thinking with the concept of the "object-oriented" programming. We 
will express our algorithms in English, then translate them into the 
programming language C++. During the course, you will learn how to use loops, 
conditionals, functions, arrays, and most importantly "classes". These are the 
building blocks of programs, which we will use to create increasingly complex 
programs. We will also cover Java in the later part of the semester.
