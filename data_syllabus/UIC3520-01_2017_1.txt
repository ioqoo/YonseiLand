An advanced fiction workshop class is essentially an advanced reading class. I will assume that students have a basic knowledge of the elements of fiction so we can read the work of writers, both past and present, that challenge and re-invent the ways that one can tell a story beyond the traditional frameworks that Janet Burroway outlines in Writing Fiction. We will focus in particular on story collections and novels in their entirety.
