The objective of this class is to understand the microstructural evolution 
with the chemistry and fabricaton process parameters to achive the wishful 
properties of materials. In order to do that, we need to know the driving 
force and mechanisms of various phase transformations, which are dependent 
upon the chemistry and environmental parameters such as temperature, time, 
pressure, mechanical work, magnetic field, etc.

This course mainly covers diffusive phase transformations in various 
materials, which prerequest information and knowledge of diffusion, 
thermodynamics, interfaces in materials, crystal structures, etc.
These kinds of phase transformations play important roles in microstructure 
control and mechanical properties of the materials
