Over the past decades, states, international organizations, non-governmental organizations have relied on economic tools of diplomacy for many purposes. This course focuses on two economic instruments: economic sanctions and foreign aid. Economic sanctions have been one of the most popular instruments of coercion. However, conventional wisdom is that sanctions have not been successful as policymakers had expected them to be. Why? How can we define sanctions and their success? Under what conditions are sanctions more likely to succeed? Are there any unintended consequences of sanctions? Foreign aid represents the ``carrots`` side of economic statecraft. While foreign aid is widely used by many actors, there is a consensus that recipient countries have failed to accomplish economic and political development as much as one would expect. What determines donor decisions on aid disbursements? What are the effects of foreign aid on recipient countries from economic and political perspectives? To answer these questions, we examine the effects of a variety of domestic, international, and cultural factors on the initiation and outcomes of economic sanctions and aid. Throughout the course, we focus on both general studies (e.g., theoretical and empirical literature on economic statecraft) and a few cases of sanctions and aid (e.g., UN sanctions against DPRK or ODA conducted by KOICA) to get balanced perspectives.
