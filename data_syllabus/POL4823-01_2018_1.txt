This course is concerned with analyzing major theories of justice in political philosophy. It covers utilitarianism, liberal equality, libertarianism, communitarianism, etc. With reading major texts written by or related to great political philosophers ranging from the ancient times to the contemporary world, such as Plato, Aristotle, Kant, John Rawls, Robert Nozick, Michael Sandel, Will Kymlicka, and so on, students are going to discuss major arguments in major theories of justice and their implications to practical politics and more particularly to contemporary Korean democracy. 

Specifically in this semester, we take Michael Sandel, Justice: What`s the Right Thing to Do and Will Kimlicka, Contemporary Political Philosophy: An Introduction as main texts. And for the sake of convenient class proceeding, each week students are supposed to read proper chapters of the book along with other supporting materials relevant to the week`s topic.
