Ecofeminism in the Time of the Anthropocene

The difficult, yet urgent, question of what it means to be human has been posed especially since the realization that we have entered a new, unprecedented epoch: the Anthropocene.  The Anthropocene, in the words of Dipesh Chakrabarty, is “the new geological epoch when humans exist as a geological force,” and this term is also becoming an occasion to critically reexamine the vital role of ecofeminism in challenging our fragmented modes of thought and life adversely affected by the confines of divisive identity politics (based on nationhood, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and class categories).   

This seminar will explore the ways in which ecofeminism as a theoretical and political movement identifies and attempts to shift away from the ostensibly unquestioned bifurcations between human beings and Nature, the West and the East, male and female, mind and body, reason and intuition, and knowledge and life.  We will read a wide variety of theoretical, historical, scientific, and cultural texts, and those readings will be oriented around a number of contemporary pressing issues: 1) humanism 2) feminism 3) transnationalism 4) democracy 5) globalization 6) environmental crisis.

As a writing-intensive seminar, this course will also be dedicated to helping students become critical and effective writers.  Students in this course will learn how to: 1) enhance a critical consciousness through critical reading; 2) advance the understanding of rhetorical knowledge; 3) effectively use preparatory writing strategies, such as drafting, revising, and workshopping; 4) form arguments and select textual evidence based on careful reading and analyses of texts; 5) present ideas clearly, coherently, and elegantly; and 6) responsibly handle primary and secondary sources using MLA style.
