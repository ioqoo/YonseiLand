This class aims to analyze how states formulate and implement its foreign policies. As a subfield of political science and international relations, Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA) illuminates the complex dynamics in many countries’ foreign policy-making and the issue of collective action in the anarchical international society. The course will nurture students’ analytical skills that will be applied to many public policy issues, not merely injecting substantive pieces of knowledge on foreign policy. Reflecting the analytical process and learning curve, this course roughly divides into three parts: theory and process of foreign policy, issues of global diplomacy, and comparative analysis of major countries’ foreign policies.
