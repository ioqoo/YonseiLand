This course is designed for UIC Asian Studies major or minor who is currently in the senior year and who is committed to writing a longer paper, namely a research project. Any UIC senior who has taken a number of Asia-related courses and who wishes to undertake a research project, whether for the purpose of applying for graduate schools or purely for intellectual reasons, is encouraged to take this class as well. 

Because participants will likely pursue different intellectual interests across the interdisciplinary field of Asian studies, this seminar will introduce different social theories, scholarly approaches, and objects of study. The first ten weeks’ readings consist of well-cited essays and scholarly works that have shaped major debates and conversations across the humanities and social sciences in the last several decades. How do these theorists and scholars come to pursue their objects of study? How do they overturn previous theories on such contentious topics as race and racism, culture and taste, diaspora and identity politics, the culture of empire, the relationship between “nature” and the human, and the intersectional aspect of our lives? These questions are certainly not identical, comparable, or analogous to one another, yet together they constitute some of the most urgent questions that humanists, social scientists, and indeed people face in a rapidly changing world.
