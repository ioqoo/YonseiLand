This course is an undergraduate-level seminar on politics of contemporary China. Understanding politics, economy, society, and their complex relations of our neighbor, People’s Republic of China becomes indispensable for everyone ? no matter what you study and pursue ? in this globalized era. In this vein, surveying politics of China would be a priority. We will try to systematically (not randomly) analyze and understand those objects through applying some theoretical frameworks of political science (esp. comparative politics) such as regime type, political institution, participation, contentious politics, clientelism, developmentalism, nationalism, and so on, to them. More specifically, this course aims at (1) understanding basic political history of contemporary China; (2) theoretically and empirically exposing students to major issues and debates in the study of reform-era Chinese politics and helping students understand major characteristics of the Chinese Communist Party regime; (3) and finally, letting students pursue their own agendas related to contemporary China in further studies in schools and job market (and beyond).
