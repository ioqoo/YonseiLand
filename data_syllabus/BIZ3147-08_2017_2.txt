This is a course in Strategy, and it is meant to give foundational knowledge on modern concepts and frameworks in this field. We will start with a focus on business strategy and build on towards more advanced topics such as platform businesses, and ambidexterity. The courses will also include the basics of Corporate Strategy, and students will have a clear understanding of the differences and their respective challenges. 

The course is about the “big picture.” It focuses on general principles of strategy that transcend industry boundaries and focuses on questions like: Where do you want to go with your organisation? What are you trying to achieve? Why? How? We will be exploring different concepts and tools that can help you understand the environment that a company finds itself in, the resources it needs to obtain, and the organisation it needs to build. Moreover, an explicit question will always be “and what do you do, at the end of the day?” We will focus on how you develop and implement a consistent and coherent strategy in today’s business world.
