Public Speech and Debate are at the heart of effective communication. They are 
central to democratic citizenship and personal responsibility in a free 
community. Persuasion is crucial to effective leadership, in government, in 
business, and in society more generally. This course will enable engaged and 
committed students to become genuinely impressive oral communicators who are 
capable of constructing rigorously argued speeches that are persuasive and 
successful in presenting a clear and compelling case. By the end of the 
course, students should have attained a level of confidence and achievement in 
public speaking to enable them to compete in international standard debate 
tournaments.
