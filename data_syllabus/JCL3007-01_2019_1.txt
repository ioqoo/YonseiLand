We face negotiation in everyday life. You may have negotiation with your parents, spouses, neighbors, professors, employers, etc. Especially, if you become a business person, a lawyer or a diplomat, more often than not, your work would not be done without going through negotiation. As a matter of fact, most jobs engage in negotiation. To acquire negotiation skills is, therefore, essential for our success. 
The goals of this course are to understand the purpose of negotiation, to develop a sound negotiation skill, and to acquire a skill to correctly reflect the outcome of negotiation on a written contractual agreement.
