What is academic writing? We will begin our journey by examining our past 
experiences with academic writing and excavating underlying assumptions. Then 
we will engage with texts written by academics who recount and reflect on 
their own academic writing journeys. Our ultimate destination would be to 
synthesize what we`ve learned by responding and reflecting on a key question 
of our own, in a synthesis essay that is cogent, clear, and compelling.

Hence the syllabus is subject to change depending on the needs of the class.
