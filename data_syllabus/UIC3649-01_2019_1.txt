UIC Seminar: Topics in Cultural Studies (“Jacques Lacan and Popular Culture (through Slavoj ?i?ek)”)

Jacques Lacan (1901-81) is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. A French psychoanalyst active not only in clinical practice but also theoretical pedagogy, Lacan left a remarkable body of work, notoriously and veritably difficult, to be grappled with by contemporary critics and practitioners. This course is a gentle introduction to Lacan’s forbidding thought by way of popular cultural discourses. For a simultaneously insightful and captivating mediation of theory and culture, we will turn to the eminent contemporary philosopher Slavoj ?i?ek, whose explication cum interpretation of Lacan through popular culture, and vice versa, will itself showcase a high form of critical practice. Come prepared to think!
