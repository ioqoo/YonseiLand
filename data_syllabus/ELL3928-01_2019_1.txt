This course examines the ideology of domesticity and separate spheres in Victorian America: historical background, core values, evolvement from mid-19th century to early 20th century, and most importantly, feminist contestations surrounding the ideology. As one of the most prevailing value systems of 19th century America, the cult of home and true womanhood tightly bound women to its “proper sphere:” home and labor to maintain the household. How female writers of the time imbibed, questioned, modified and appropriated the ideology? How differences in class and race were intersected with the common dilemmas and problems faced by 19th century American females would be the questions that this course explores.
