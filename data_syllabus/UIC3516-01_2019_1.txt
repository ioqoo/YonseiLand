We will study traditional and experimental structures of narrative, with a particular emphasis on the short story. By studying different uses of point of view and the use of restrictive forms, ranging from the traditional to collage and the list form, students will experiment to revise existing stories-in-progress and to expand their creative range. We will study various writers and learn by imitation, if desired.
