Rock and roll music, possibly the biggest cultural export of the United States in the 20th Century, is not just a music style. It is an attitude, spirit, social statement, and badge of identity that carries Zeitgeist of a certain era. 

Naturally, there is something about American rock and roll that distinguishes itself from the music from the other parts of the world. Whether it was Bob Dylan’s poetic approach, James Brown’s soulful cry, Bruce Springsteen’s blue collar spirit, or Michael Jackson’s breaking the color barrier on MTV, 
American rock and roll has always carried a unique American identity of some sort.

Following a loose chronology, this course aims to provide American rock and roll and its narrative history from social, cultural, political, and aesthetical standpoints. In order to examine American rock evolution, our discussions will involve musical elements, visual elements, lyrical contents, and social 
impact of major American rock artists of the last century.
