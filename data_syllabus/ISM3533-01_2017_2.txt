This course is intended to be an introduction to the idea of human rights.  
The objective will be to develop a critical understanding of the major 
issues surrounding human rights, as well as the intellectual roots 
of the modern-day concept of human right.  The focus will be more on 
the philosophical and historical aspects of human rights, rather than on the 
institutional features of international human rights law.  The justification 
for this approach is the conviction that a firm grasp of the historical and 
theoretical issues will provide a better foundation for understanding the 
contemporary legal issues and debates.  
 The course will be divided into two equal parts, which roughly 
correspond to the two components of the idea of “human rights.”  The first 
part—-dealing with the "human" part—-will examine the historical development 
of the concept of human rights.  The underlying theme will be: Who counts as a 
human being?  We will study some of the ancient, medieval, and early modern
intellectual traditions that contributed to the modern conception of human 
rights.  In the second part—-dealing with the "rights" part-—we will cover 
some of the current theoretical controversies surrounding human rights, which 
will be useful for understanding the modern practice of human rights. Here, 
the underlying theme will be: What does it mean to have a right?
