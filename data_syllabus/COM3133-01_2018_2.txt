This class is designed to survey the immediate history of South Korean film and criticism with regard to film production, distribution, and reception.  By 
employing interdisciplinary and media approaches, we will examine cinematic representations in the context of such themes as history and memory, gender and sexuality, national and cultural identity.  Also focus will be given to formal aspects of the films, including narrative styles and cinematography.  We will seek out a basic understanding of cinema as an art form and as a manifestation of contemporary Korean popular culture.

The course aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible overview of the state of Korean cinema and scholarship.  It does not require previous knowledge about Korean history or films.  Rather, this class will be an invitation to better understand contemporary Korean culture and society.  For instance, you will learn how cultures, traditions, and national identities are expressed through films and will further explore and complicate the relations of the film to society, culture, memory, and history.  The questions to be addressed include but are not limited to: What makes Korean cinema “Korean”?  How is it different from other “national cinemas”?  How have film criticisms, both popular and academic, interrogated Korean films?  How are social issues such as gender, sexuality, class, and race played out or subdued in filmic representations?  What qualities warrant popular aesthetic praise?  What are the films’ conditions of production, circulation, and reception?  How have Korean films been marketed to international audiences, and how similar or different have they been from the marketing strategies in the local market?

*The syllabus is subject to change and modification.  The final version will be distributed on the first day of class.
