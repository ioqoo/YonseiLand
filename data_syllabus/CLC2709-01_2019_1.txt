As an introductory lesson of East Asian art, I will first look at prehistoric art, Buddhist art, ceramics and traditional paintings. And we will survey the art theory and issues of East Asian traditional paintings through specific articles. 

And then we  will explore East Asian paintings focusing on  traditional Korean paintings. Joseon Korea had close contacts with China and Japan. In art, there was active interaction among three countries. Thus, Joseon painting is not separable from the developments of Chinese and Japanese painting. This class will look into how Joseon painting expanded its thematic and stylistic range in terms of “transnationalism.” It will also helps to understand not only the context of Joseon culture but also East Asian painting as a whole.

In addition, we will have case studies of the "masterpieces" during the Joseon Dynasty, Korea. Through these studies, we will discuss why some art works are considered masterpieces and what makes a masterpiece.
