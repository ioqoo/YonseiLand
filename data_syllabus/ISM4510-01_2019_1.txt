Course Description: This course is designed to provide a broad historical as well as conceptual introduction of U.S. foreign policy and global perspective on it. Major events and doctrines, along with Asia policy, of each administration will be discussed in historical context. As such the course examines drivers, stakeholders and major institutions that determine the U.S. foreign policy decision-making process.  The class discussion will focus on persisting debates in the U.S. foreign policy tradition: isolationism vs internationalism, multilateralism vs unilateralism, idealism vs realism, promotion of democracy and human right vs non-interventionism and imperial overstretch.
