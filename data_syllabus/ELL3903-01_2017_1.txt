This course surveys playwrights (and poets) in the English Renaissance. We will study, of course, such a colossal figure as Shakespeare, but we will study authors whose names have been eclipsed by Shakespeare such as Marlowe, Kyd, Webster, and Spenser. This era witnessed the rise of English theatre as a secular and commercial form, and the advent of theatre is coterminous with cultural transformations affecting people’s changed understandings of religion, social classes, and nation state. The rise of print-capitalism and the discovery of new worlds in this period radically changed people’s philosophy and culture. This course, in this light, will examine the relationship between early modern literature and society mainly through the lens of the early modern dramas (and poetry) produced in response to these changes. The issues to be explored over the semester will extensively include (not be limited to) the rise of commercial theatre in London, class mobility and gender construction in this period, the rise of early modern colonialism, and revenge tragedies as a new cultural form, and the advent of print capitalism and the nation formation.
