Calculus is a branch of mathematics whose primary purpose is the study of motion and change. It is an indispensable tool of thought in almost every 
field of pure and applied science in physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, geology, engineering, and even some of the social sciences. It also has many important uses in other parts of mathematics.
The main goal of this course is to study advanced Calculus containing mathematical concepts and applications so as to give creative and logical way 
of thinking, assuming on fundamental knowledge of highschool math.
 



This course is for students working on a degree in nscience, mathematics, 
Engineering as well as computer science, those planning on graduate work in 
some areas, and for others who are simply interested. This course emphasizes 
skills, theory, and applications. Calculus opens the door to higher 
mathematics, science, and technology.
