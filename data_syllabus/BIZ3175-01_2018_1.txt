Students will be exposed to various aspects of legal issues in business 
management. Actual cases and related film footages may be used to stimulate 
class discussions. Due to the market failure that the world economy is 
experiencing now, governments around the world are tightening their grips on 
corporations through numerous regulatory schemes. Students will discuss and 
learn about those regulatory issues which restrict or promote today`s 
corporate activities. Because this class covers a wide range of legal issues, 
students` participation will be strongly encouraged and properly graded. Many 
cases will be analyzed and discussed during class in light of today`s viewpoint.
