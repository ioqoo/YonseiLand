Syllabus_Korean
##
This is a calculus based general physics course covering vectors, motion in 
one and two dimensions, Newton’s laws, work and energy, momentum, collisions, 
rotational motions, elasticity, oscillations, fluid mechanics, waves in 
elastic media, sound waves, three laws of thermodynamics.
Experiments include free fall, gravitational acceleration, projectile motion, 
conservation of linear momentum, ballistic pendulum, moment of inertia, 
venturi apparatus, harmonic oscillation, damped oscillation, Doppler effect in 
sound, energy transfer-thermoelectric, cyclic heat engine.
Measurements of physical quantities in some of Experiments can be done via 
computer interfaced data acquisition system. All experimental equipments and 
apparatus are highly sophisticated.
With a prior notice, the Lab schedule can be changed depending on Lab 
conditions.
Written laboratory reports including data reduction and error analysis are 
required and should be submitted within a week after each experiment.
