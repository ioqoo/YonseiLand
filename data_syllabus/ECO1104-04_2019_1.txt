Macroeconomics is the branch that studies large-scale economies. 
Macroeconomics observes and analyzes how entire countries, full of many 
industries and consumers, function. It is not simply the sum of 
many "microeconomics"; many of the concepts are entirely different. Where 
micro will study a single consumer, a paper-clip manufacturing plant or the 
airline industry, macro studies the entire economy within which those three 
exist. Macroeconomics studies elements of a large economy, including 
inflation, government policies, output growth, and unemployment.on the other 
hand, takes a much broader view by analyzing the economic activity of an 
entire country or the international marketplace.
