Throughout the course, we will explore various topics relating to law, including, among others, the following: What is law?; Why do we have to obey law?; Is law merely "discovered" by humans or created by humans?; Who makes law?; What kinds of laws exist around the world?; What are the most important and basic legal principles commonly found around the world?; What is a good law?; and, What is justice?. To find out the answers to these questions, we will explore a variety of different legal systems.

If you actively engage in this class, you will be able:  
-to develop a firm understanding of ‘the definition and role of the law’and ‘the role of different actors of the law’; 
-to develop a critical and analytical thinking skill; and,
-to develop a balanced and flexible view on the law which is not prejudiced by a certain specific legal system.
