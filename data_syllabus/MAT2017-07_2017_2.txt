We study Fourier series which are fundamental to scientists and engineers. 
The importance of the Fourier series comes from the significance of their 
physical interpretations, such as time frequency analysis of signals, as well 
as the fact that Fourier analytic techniques are extremely powerful. 
We study partial differential equations which arise in connection with various 
physical and geometrical problems. 
Using Fourier series analysis, we solve the boundary value problems of partial 
differential equations, such as heat equations and wave equations. 
Finally, we cover data analysis, probability theory, and mathematical 
statistics.
