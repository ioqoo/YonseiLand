As the structure and property of material are closely related to each other, 
the crystallography forms a basis for materials science. The comprehension of 
crystalline geometry is essential not only in such  materials science areas as 
X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, but also in many 
material-based device designs.  This course aims at broadening a general 
understanding of the crystal geometry and covers lattice and reciprocal 
lattice, crystal structures of important materials, symmetry elements, point 
and space groups.
