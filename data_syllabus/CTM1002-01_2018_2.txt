The role of IT has been increased in accordance with the development of machine learning. Now, many renowned B-schools have lectures involving machine learning. Machine learning is a method used to generate complex models and algorithms for analysts to produce reliable, reproducible decisions and results as well as to uncover hidden insights through learning from patterns in data. In data science, machine learning takes data, processes it via classification/clustering algorithms to help organizations extract insights and make decisions. Machine learning supports human to make better solutions for various problems: fraud detection, prediction of equipment failures, web search results, new pricing models, online recommendation, network intrusion detection, online marketing, pattern and image recognition, credit scoring, email spam filtering, cancer prediction, self-driving car, chess, go, and so on. This IT Foundation course is specialized in data analytics using computer programs implementing machine learning algorithms.
