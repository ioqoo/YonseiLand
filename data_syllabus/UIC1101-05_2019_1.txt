This course is designed to help you become a successful academic writer, reader, and thinker. Through lecture, collaborative practice and diverse workshops that involve developing ideas, drafting, and revising, you will understand writing as a process. Thematically, the course will take the mutually defining categories of gender and race/ethnicity as its focus. We will discuss Feminism and Post-colonialism and investigate racial and gender stereotypes embedded in our cultural consciousness. 

This course will help you through the process or researching, reading, and writing in an analytical way so that you can eventually function as a critical consumer and citizen in society. To this end, we will explore diverse genres of cultural production, both print and non-print form. The primary texts include but not limited to public speeches, essays, poems, short stories, advertisements, commercials, national campaigns, paintings, and films.
