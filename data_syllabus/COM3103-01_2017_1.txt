Welcome to the International Communication.  This course is designed to gain 
comprehensive understanding about conceptual and practical aspects of 
international communication, with special emphasis on the flow of news. A 
variety of issues on the media globalization will be discussed. In doing so, 
we shall examine an array of theoretical, empirical, and policy-oriented 
literature to throw light on different aspects of international media. 
Competing and contrasting theories and perspectives will be comparatively and 
critically examined. Another purpose of this class is to make students take 
out their English under the sun.  My wish is to let you practice English as 
much as possible. It is therefore important to use English only in the 
classroom. After all, English is the most dominant medium for international 
communication.
