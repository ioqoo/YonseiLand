Basic concepts of toxicology as they apply to the effects of environmental 
agents, e.g. chemicals, metals, on public health. We will discuss the 
distribution, cellular penetration, metabolic conversion, and elimination of 
toxic agents, as well as the fundementallaws governing the interaction of 
foreign chemicals with biological systems. We will discuss in depth the 
toxicology of selected organs and agents and the science underlying testing 
for the ability of chemicals to elicit adverse human health effects. We will 
touch upon the role of toxicology in the risk assessment process.
