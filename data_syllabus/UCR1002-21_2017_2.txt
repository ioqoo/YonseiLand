Creative Art Studio emphasizes the perceptual, analytical, and imaginative 
approaches to drawing that support broader art and design processes. 
The perceptual component develops eye, mind, and hand coordination through the 
objective observation of the human figure, still life, and space. 
The role of the analytical component is to develop an understanding of 
methods, concepts,and drawing systems, such as anatomical, orthographic, 
paraline, and perspective drawing. The imaginative component emphasizes 
experimental approaches, thinking outside the box and the development of the 
student`s personal voice.
