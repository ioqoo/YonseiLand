“Political reform is important, but no reform will be greater than promoting popular awareness.”  Victor Bello Accioly

Government legitimacy is in a season of crisis, making the awareness and study of political thought especially relevant. This class pursues that study primarily through Western political philosophies addressing the intersections of the government, economy, community, and individual. How should these intersections be legitimately arranged, and how do we pragmatically and normatively justify that form? With this foundation, we can analyze and critique any polity’s features and members.  

WE CONSIDER POLITICAL THOUGHT THROUGH TEN MODULES: 

(1) WHAT IS POLITICAL THOUGHT? 
(2) POLITY’S BUILDING BLOCKS: HUMAN NATURE
(3) GOVERNANCE GOALS
(4) VOX POPULI ? REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY
(5) DEMOCRACY’S CRITIQUES & ALTERNATIVES
(6) RIGHTS ? WHERE DOES YOUR ‘NOSE’ BEGIN?
(7) VALUES: PROPERTY ? WHO GETS WHAT?
(8) MATURING DEMOCRACIES ? SOUTH KOREA’S CHALLENGES
(9) THE NEW PARADIGM: NATIONALISM ? US v THEM
(10) NON-WESTERN VIEWS & OTHER THOUGHTS
