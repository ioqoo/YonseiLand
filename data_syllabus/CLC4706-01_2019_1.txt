This course aims to help you understand the main ethical and aesthetical 
features of contemporary Western culture by analyzing its roots in the history 
of philosophical and religious thought. For that purpose, we will look into 
some of the salient contents of Judeo-Christian revelation and how they 
influenced the formation and development of European culture. We will be 
dealing especially with some key notions such as “God”, “Logos”, “human 
destiny”,“nature”,“time”, as conceived in ancient Greece and transformed 
by Christianity.
An examination of the cultural changes brought about by the novelty of the 
Christian synthesis in arts, ethics, science, politics, economy and world 
relations will follow.
