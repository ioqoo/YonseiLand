Coming-of-Age in a Global Context

What does it mean to come of age? How has literature shaped our understanding of youth and the experience of growing up?
Does coming-of-age gain different meaning in today`s globalized world? As a genre about socialization, the Bildungsroman 
has held a central presence within literary studies for addressing such questions. Focusing on coming-of-age stories of the
late twentieth and twenty-first century, this course explores how contemporary writers have re-envisioned the Bildungsroman 
in order to locate the experience of growing up in the contexts of immigration, diaspora, war, and globalization. Particular
attention will be given to the ways the genre`s concerns with development and formation intersect with contemporary questions
about race, gender, class, and multilingualism.
