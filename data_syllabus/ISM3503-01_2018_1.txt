This course discusses the complex nature of East Asian international order. The first half of the course explores the power structures in East Asia before the Cold War and experiences of colonialism and recurring wars have affected the interactions between East Asian countries and the rest of the world. The second half of the course will examine how well existing IR theories explain major security and economic developments in East Asia after the end of the Cold War. We examine why the U.S. and its Northeast Asian allies maintain intense economic ties with China despite rising security competition, and how such economic interdependence has shaped East Asian relations in the midst of a new regional order. This course will end by examining present and future challenges to the stability of the East Asian region.
