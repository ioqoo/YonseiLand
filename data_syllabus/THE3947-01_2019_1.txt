The main purpose is to explore the global approaches to the Christian education to encourage our faith and our understanding of the only Son of God, Jesus Christ, for reshaping our Christian identities and forming the transformative selves in an era of post-conventional society and in depth of post-global transition. 
"This will continue until we are united by our faith and by our understanding of the Son of God. Then we will be mature, just as Christ, and we will be completely like him" (Ephesian 4:13).
