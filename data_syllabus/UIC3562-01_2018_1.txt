Art of Rhetoric  

This seminar is concerned with the rhetorical dimensions of literature, which establish 
unresolved tensions between literary and referential language, between literature, 
knowledge, and ethics. Part of the classical trivium, with grammar and logic, rhetoric 
can be conceived in terms of both literary figures and modes of persuasion. Beginning 
with Plato, Aristotle, and Longinus, we will examine the relationship between tropes --
metaphor, metonymy, simile, synecdoche, etc. -- and persuasion in oratorical and literary 
contexts. We will then move to Nietzsche, who asserts the rhetoricity of truth (“A mobile 
army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropomorphisms”), before concluding with 
“deconstructive” treatments of figural language by J. Hillis Miller and Paul de Man.
