##
Teach students how to use ordinary differential equations(ODEs), partial 
differential equations(PDEs), series solutions, and transformation-based 
approaches like Laplace transform, Fourier transform as tools for problem 
solving. Most concepts presented in the context of physical problems that arise 
in industry, government, science and engineering.

##
This course deals with various kinds of differential equations and their 
solution methods, such as ordinary differential equations(ODEs), partial 
differential equations(PDEs), series solutions, and transformation-based 
approaches like Laplace transform, Fourier transform, etc. The course covers 
not only basic theories for differential equations and solution methods, but 
also practical examples from this course will lay a very helpful foundation for 
studying other advanced subjects in materials science.
