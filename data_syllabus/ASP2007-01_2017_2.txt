The Korean War (1950-1953) was horrific in its violence and profoundly consequential for the two Koreas, of course, but also for East Asia and beyond. In South Korea, especially among the older generation, and certainly in American public memory, the Korean War is remembered as an instance of UN/American rescue that saved South Korea and enabled its eventual economic and political ascent. But that simplistic view cannot account for the decisions, events, and experiences that point to much more complex and equivocal memories about the Korean War. 

To acquire critical understanding of competing narratives about the Korean War, we examine questions such as: To what degree was the Korean War a denouement of cleavages and conflicts from the colonial period? What kind of political and social dynamic emerged after collapse of the Japanese empire in 1945, and U.S. forces occupied southern Korea and the Soviet Army occupied northern Korea? What was the character of the governments that came to be established north and south of the 38th parallel in 1948? What led to the outbreak of the war in 1950? How was the war waged? What kind of ideas, practices, and governmentalities emerged from the war?
