This course was historically notorious for its difficulty.
Many students had withdrawn the course and received an F as a letter grade, 
which may be your case unless you study enough (1-2 hours per day)!!!
The goal of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the 
mathematical study of statistics. Topics include probability, univariate 
distributions, multivariate distributions, functions of random variables, and 
limiting distributions. Emphasis will be on the theoretical development of 
each topic, including definitions, theorems, and proofs.
