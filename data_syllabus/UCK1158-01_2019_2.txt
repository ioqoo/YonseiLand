While it is assumed that students have the ability to write paragraphs and essays, class essays employ argument and analysis based on evidence. But time will be given to review these writing skills.

For final assessment, you will most likely be assigned an essay and/or several Matrix-Gaming scenarios. 

World Issues Honours students will be utilizing, among others, `Jane`s World Insurgency and Terrorism,` as well as `Jane`s Country Risk Assessment` which are only available on Yonsei campus through this class. (Accessed by the professor from Cambridge University and The British Library.)
In addition there are numerous news sources and documentaries in English which offer further insight.

The class aims to give an overview of the war in Syria. The crisis reveals many drivers which need to be considered if better understanding is to be acquired. This demands consideration of the roles of; 

Intra-Syrian players including the Assad government and the rebels. 
Regional state-level actors who feel compelled to intervene. 
Competition between regional actors and the somewhat irrelevance of the war itself to that dynamic.
Religion and how significant a driver it is.
Chaos and how it creates space for extremism.
Russia and its contribution. 
The affect the region has had on Syria and vice versa.
The Kurds. 
Non-state actors. 
The absence of US leadership. 

Yonsei students have access to first rate analysis, and I hope to reveal this can be revealed to you.

Where time allows, other topics will be covered such as the crisis in Yemen or our seeming inability to cope with `fake news.`
