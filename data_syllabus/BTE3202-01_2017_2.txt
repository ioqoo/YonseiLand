Policy on homeworks and exams
1. All homework reports must be turned in on time. Late ones will not be 
considered. Reports only in an electronic version will be accepted via email 
to the TA (parkeulsoo [eul2000@hotmail.com]). 

2. Students are totally responsible for a missing exam. However, students are 
allowed for make-up examinations which have been missed due to an unavoidable 
circumstance. But the make-up exam is only allowed when the student let the 
instructor know of the circumstance by cell phone or email before the exam 
hour. To take a make-up exam, students should show official documents to prove 
the circumstance. 

Ethical conduct
1. Copying homework from any other sources, including the web, and submitting 
it constitutes an unethical behavior.  If you are found to copy homework, you 
will lose 10 pt without any excuse being considered. 

2. There will be zero tolerance for cheating an exam in this course.  If you 
are caught cheating an exam, you will get zero credit for the exam.
