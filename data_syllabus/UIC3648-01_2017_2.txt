The 19th-century French novelist Gustave Flaubert famously aspired to write novels “about nothing.” He inaugurated a uniquely modern form of literature: novels that derive their intrigue not from sensational plots and extraordinary protagonists, but instead from closely observed descriptions of the everyday experiences of common or, indeed, socially marginal characters. In this course, we will examine 20th-century French novels that take a radical approach to Flaubert’s proposition. Informed additionally by Freud’s revelations about the dramas of psychic life, the novels we will read develop distinctive ways of conceiving of and depicting psychological interiority. 

We will spend first half of the semester on the Proustian “revolution” in the writing of subjectivity. The four remaining authors (much shorter novels) tackle interiority?and attendant questions of gender, class, the problem of alienation, the meaning of freedom?from perspectives representative of major intellectual currents in 20th-century French thought: Surrealism, Existentialism, the New Novel, Oulipo, and Marxism.
