Introduction to the classification, structure, reactions, and reaction mechanisms of carbon compounds. The general outcome goals are that students will understand the classification, structure, nomenclature, reactions, reaction mechanisms, and synthesis of carbon compounds including halocarbons, alkenes, and alcohols. Thereby, this course can provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of organic chemistry essential for the rational study of biochemistry, molecular biology, and materials applications of polymers.
