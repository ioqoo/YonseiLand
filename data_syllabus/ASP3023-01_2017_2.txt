This course examines the social, political and cultural dimensions of 
transnational migration and momentous changes in Asian cities driven by 
transnational flows of people. Drawing upon theoretical approaches as well as 
ethnographic work, this interdisciplinary course encourages students to 1) 
develop a conceptual understanding of transnational migration and urban space, 
2) understand the issues emerging from particular migration regimes and their 
relations with migrant experiences in Asia, and, 3) critically analyse 
migration processes and space produced by migrants in Asian cities. Students 
are required to do mini-ethnographical studies focused on transnational space 
and write an ethnographically based paper. 

The course is divided into three parts. We begin by exploring the theoretical 
discussion in recent literature on “transnationalism,” “transnational 
migration in Asia,” and “migrants and urban space.” We move on to discuss 
case studies of specific transnational migrants and their place-making 
practices in urban space. Finally, we examine your mini-ethnographical studies 
on transnational space in Korea based on those common threads from our 
theoretical discussions, and shared analysis of case studies in Asian cities.
