□ Computational Thinking focuses on introducing basic knowledge of computing along with logical reasoning and problem solving skills. Students will repeatedly practice how to self-define problems and find the corresponding solution and conceptualize it. Understanding how to express computing is essential for everyone who expects to live and work in a world where information is stored, accessed and manipulated. Such concepts are applicable and relevant for everyone and strongly recommended for those studying non-computer science majors. Grafting computational knowledge with other disciplines will create a synergy effect and broaden the boundary of work that can be done by an individual.
