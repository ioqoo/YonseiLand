Defining presidential power and understanding the process of presidential policy-making has been a mystifying task for students of the presidency as well as its practitioners. Many tools of social science have been applied to the study of the presidency, including psychological theories, sophisticated econometric techniques, historical analysis, and survey research. In this course we will survey some of this work in an attempt to understand the role of the president in the political system. We will examine the various theoretical approaches to studying the presidency, presidential selection, presidential power, interbranch relations, the role of the public, political parties, and the media, and presidential policy-making in foreign and domestic policy. I will also provide a historical perspective, emphasizing changes in the nature of the presidency in the 200-year history of the United States. Many of the examples of a given concept or topic will come from the Trump presidency, but we will draw on the experiences of other presidents as well. Obviously, this is an unusual time for the American presidency. One of the goals of this class is to give you the tools to place this recent experience in a broader historical and institutional context.

The goal of this class is to provide you with an understanding of how the president operates within the US political system. What makes for a successful president? How can we explain why some presidents succeed and others fail? How can we make sense of the current presidency - how is it similar to and different than previous presidencies?
