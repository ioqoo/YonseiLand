Depictions of women have played an important role in constructing Western stereotypes about Islam. The harem, veiling, and polygyny have all played a critical part in shaping contemporary attitudes towards Islam at the start of the twenty-first century. This course will work to place these practices within a historical framework, transcending some of 
the stigmas surrounding issues of gender and sexuality in Islam to highlight the critical role played by women in the formation of Islamic political, social, and cultural history. 
By focussing on the ‘Classical Age of Islam’ (circa 600-1000CE), this course will demonstrate the important contribution of women to the formation of an Islamic Civilization. 

This course is intended to advance the students’ understanding of global processes, to improve their ability to conduct independent research, to read both primary sources and 
modern sources critically, and to develop critical thinking and reasoning skills in a historical context. Having completed this course students will be able to:
- Demonstrate an understanding of key themes in the study of Islamic and Middle Eastern history.
- Analyse and explicate major ideas associated with the history of the Islamic world.
- Explain relationships between intellectual developments of the Islamic world and broader issues of historical context.
- Use period sources to reconstruct attitudes, beliefs and arguments from the past.
- Construct evidence-based arguments about the legacy of important events in Islamic history.
