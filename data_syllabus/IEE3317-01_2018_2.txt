The first part of the course will start by examining the general media 
landscape and then go on to look at the various factors in the development of 
Korean media. Since the development of Korean media is closely linked with 
various social and political factors in the development of democracy in Korean 
society, a critical aspect of the first part of this course is to be able to 
have a sense of Korean political history. We will be viewing the movies 
“PeppermentCandy”and “Tae Guk Gi: Brotherhood of War” to this effect. 
Factors that affect the characteristics of Korean newspapers will be examined 
in the first part of the course. 

In the second part of the course, we will examine the extent of the influence 
of traditional media such as newspapers and broadcasting and compare it with 
the influence of newer forms of media that are being offered through the 
Internet such as Blogs, SNS, youtube videos, and podcasts. We will try to 
understand the influence of these newer media in changing the Korean political 
and social culture.

The third and last part will look at the Korean media audience and try to 
understand the “Korean Wave”(Hanryu, Hallyu) not just in Asian countries but 
also around the world.
