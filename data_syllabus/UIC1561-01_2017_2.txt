The course will focus on one of the pillars of Western aesthetics, the concept of mimesis (imitation or representation). Starting from the ancient roots of the debate--from Plato’s and Aristotle’s opposing views to the Neoplatonists--we will follow the evolution of the idea of mimesis and its impact on multifarious artistic practices through the Renaissance to our days. Particular emphasis will be given to literary realism, one of the most successful and controversial forms of mimetic thinking in Western arts. Honore de Balzac’s and Gustave Flaubert’s novels Pere Goriot and Madame Bovary will serve as test cases for some of the theoretical hypothesis on mimesis we will be discussing in class.
