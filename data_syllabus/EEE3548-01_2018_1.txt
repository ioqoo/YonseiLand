This course will provide an overview of the basic and advanced principles, concepts, and operations of bio-medical sensors and devices associated with both software and hardware knowledge. We will review some circuit theory, its application to bioinstrumentation, and current research in this field. Systems for measuring biologic signals will be discussed including biopotentials (e.g., EEG, ECG etc), stress and strain, pressure, temperature, and optical properties. We will develop an understanding of the measurement of respiratory function, cardiac variables, blood pressure, blood flow as well as medical devices. Electrical hazards, safety, measuring instruments and techniques will be discussed. There will be applications to engineering design including transducer systems and sensing and driving circuits. There will also be discussions of ethical and regulatory issues related to bioinstrumentation. T

1) Half for Bio-Hard (Biomedical Instrument System by Prof. Ki Jun Yu)
2) Half for Bio-Soft (Software & Signal Processing sense by Prof. Dosik Hwang)
