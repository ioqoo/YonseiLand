The discipline of International Relations (IR) is generally seen as a sub-field of Political Science. It also belongs to the interdisciplinary area of International Studies since IR is focused on the international dimension. IR has generated its own set of theories, meant to describe, explain, and predict international affairs generally, but mostly the political interactions of states. This part of IR will be the core subject of this class.
The discipline of IR is marked by the absence of one consensus theory. Instead, IR knows of a whole spectrum of theories, paradigms, pre-theories, and theoretical ‘bits and pieces.’ In light of these multitudes, the course focuses on the core and the standard canon of IR theory (IRT). The much interesting material will be left out in the order to a deeper engagement with this core.
The purpose of IRT is to support the analysis of international (mostly political) events. Therefore, the course links theoretical work with the application of theory to the investigation of the international political world.
At the end of the semester, the student will be familiar the central canon of IRT and be trained in applying theory in the analysis of world events.
