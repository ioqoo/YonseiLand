As George Lukacs famously put it, the novel is the epic of the modern age in which epic totality is no longer possible.  Yet, as Lukacs immediately would add, not all novels deserve that honour of standing in for the epic.  In this course we will be reading two great (in quantity as in quality) novels which veritably embody an epic totality of the modern world--with all its inevitable contradictions and idealism. Some eminent theorists of the novel, including Lukacs, will also be included in the reading list. Works to be read this semester are Honore de Balzac`s [Lost Illusions] and Leo Tolstoy`s [Anna 
Karenina].  English translations will be used but a knowledge of the original language would no doubt be welcome.
