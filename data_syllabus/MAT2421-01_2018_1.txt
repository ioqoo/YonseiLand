The primary purpose of this course is to analyze the formulation and solution of representative problems that arise in the physical sciences and are modeled by differential equations. In this course, we begin with studying ordinary differential equations and their applications including modeling. Next, we study systems of differential equations which occur in various application. We also study Bessel`s equation, Legendre`s equation, and Laplace transforms.
