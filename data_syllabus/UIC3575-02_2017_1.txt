The twelve-year rule of the Nazi regime (1933-45) and its results ? the Second World War, the murder of six million European Jews and the neologism, “genocide,” which it inspired ? have provided an ugly hallmark for the analysis of modern German history.  Historians have interpreted the century preceding the “Third Reich” and the post-war period through the lenses of German fascism and the Holocaust.  However, the collapse of the German Democratic Republic and German (re-)unification in 1990 has created havoc with many historical narratives of modern Germany. For that reason, this course is structured as not merely a survey but also a study of the major issues animating the scholarship of modern Germany.
