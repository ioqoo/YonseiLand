This course is an exploration of human sensibilities, taste and desire through 
a wide array of inter-disciplinary readings in cultural anthropology, 
literature and theory.  One of the central focuses will be ‘beauty,’ not so 
much the object, but more importantly the politics surrounding its notion and 
manifestation.  We live in an era of inundation of media that operate as means 
of production, dissemination and consumption of the information, images and 
imaginations that constitute the material and non-material aspect of our 
culture.  The course is divided into four sections: 
Section 1, The Girl and Beauty
Section 2, Beauty and Ethnic Markers
Section 3, Fashion and Social Meanings
Section 4, Beauty Practices and Cosmetic Surgery
