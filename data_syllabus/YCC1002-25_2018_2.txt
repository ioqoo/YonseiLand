##
During the semester we will look at different topics in English. For each of 
these topics we will consider vocabulary and grammar and we will also practice 
related listening, reading, writing, speaking, and pronunciation.

Homework is intended to total more than the class hours.

Class Participation 
Be polite with others and participate in what we are doing and there will be 
no problem getting your participation mark.

Homework

Weekly homework cannot be submitted late and, simply, my website will not 
accept it. Major assignments can be handed in late but your grade will be 
reduced.

Possible Changes

It is impossible to know every variable that might affect the class. It is 
possible that I will make changes during the semester in order to make the 
class more relevant for students or to make it run more smoothly.
