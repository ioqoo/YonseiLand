We will read closely and analyze particular aspects of myths that lie at the 
cores of establishments which engender fringe-, sub-, and counter-cultures 
through various manifestations of dissent, resistance and protest. In 
reviewing specific texts that arise out of such oppositions, we will engage 
the following question: to what extent do certain critiques of dominant 
pedagogical, financial, scientific, medical (allopathic), artistic and 
spiritual institutions offer viable alternatives to mainstreams? While we will 
touch upon theories of deviance, labeling, criminality, pathology and 
conspiracy, our main focus will be on actively researching, discussing and 
practicing means to effect positive cultural, social and personal change with 
the ultimate goal of individual and societal well-being.
