Course Description

The Freshman Writing Intensive Seminar (FWIS) emphasizes written analysis of a 
wide range of texts, which can include literary works such as short stories, 
poems, novels, and plays; nonfiction prose, historical documents, film, 
speeches, web sites; and visual images such as photographs and advertisements. 
Through both formal and informal writing assignments, students practice a 
variety of methods for reading and analyzing these texts. They consider how 
both personal experience and other contexts shape a readerâ€™s understanding of 
a text, and they examine how language reflects the values and structures of the 
culture within which it is produced.

Specific aspects of writing emphasized in FWIS include the following:

* Style, Accuracy, and Clarity of Expression
 
* Thesis Development

* Textual Evidence

* Close Reading

* Organization

* Summary and Critique

* Formatting

* Awareness of Different Writing Contexts

* Research And Creative Writing
