This course deals with a number of fundamental mathematical 
concepts such as sets, algorithms, basic number theory, 
mathematical induction, complexity, counting methods, permutations 
and combinations, probablity, recurrence relations, graph theory, 
and trees.

I hope that by the end of the course you`ll have developed logical 
and creative way of thinking through this important branch of 
mathematics, and have the expertise necessary to develop a deeper 
relationship with pure mathematics and/or with applied one which 
you will meet in your future studies.
