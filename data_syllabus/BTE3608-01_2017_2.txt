This course focuses on the interface between chemistry and biology with an 
emphasis on the identification, design, synthesis, and application of 
biologically active small molecules.  Such small molecules may be used to 
study fundamental biological processes or they may be developed as therpeutic 
agents targeting specific diseases.  
We will discuss topics such as forward and reverse chemical genetics, genetic 
engineering and in vivo drug synthesis, and novel methods of chemical library 
synthesis.  With each topic covered in lecture, we will read and discuss 
primary research papers.
