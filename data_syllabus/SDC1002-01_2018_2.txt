This course is an introduction to the central principles of international affairs and foreign affairs. We will start with the course with the traditional approaches to the study of power, state interest, and international relations. Then we will move on to see how such different tools of statecraft affect a broad array of contemporary global problems from social inequality and climate change to terrorism and human rights. This course is not an introduction to international studies that focuses on the rigorous learning of the theories of international relations. Rather, this course is to provide a broad overview to the politics of various global affairs and to advance our understanding on how different party interests converge and diverge on these matters.
