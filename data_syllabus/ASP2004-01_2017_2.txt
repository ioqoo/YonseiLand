This course explores the Japanese Empire from the late nineteenth century to 1945 and its legacy in the postwar years, particularly focusing on texts produced from the perspectives of a variety of ambiguous actors among the colonizers and the colonized. The main readings are from Reading Colonial Japan: Text, Context, and Critique edited by Michele Mason and Helen Lee (Stanford UP, 2012) as well as other materials including primary and secondary sources. The topics include: colonization of the indigenous Ainu; Okinawa under the Japanese and American rules; colonial Taiwan in perspective; diversity of Korean experience; settlers in Japanese colonies; Manchuria and wartime empire; and postcolonial identity construction. Students are expected to gain knowledge of a variety of colonial experiences under the Japanese Empire and beyond and better understand colonial processes as a series of political, economic, and cultural exchanges through negotiation, struggle, collaboration, and resistance.
