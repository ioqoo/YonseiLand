This course examines how various components of the climate system--the 
atmosphere, ocean, land, and cryosphere--interact and what mechanisms rules 
out in determining its observed state. 
Basic topics: observations of the climate system; the earth`s energy balance; 
atmospheric radiative transfer; the surface energy balance; the hydrologic 
cycle; atmospheric and oceanic circulation and its relation to the energy 
balance; the role of the ocean and the cryosphere. 
Special topics: natural and anthropogenic climate change, El Nino, PDO, 
thermhaline circulation, so on.
