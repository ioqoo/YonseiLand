History and Fiction: Robert Louis Stevenson, Scotland and the Pacific Islands

The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-94) is best remembered today for his novels Treasure Island and Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. In addition to these classic tales, he also wrote dozens of other novels and stories, experimenting with fiction to explore his deep interest in the history of Scotland. During the last six years of his life he lived in the Pacific, where he continued to write fiction but in a different way and with new subjects. While the history of Scotland remained a source of fascination, he became engaged with the cultures of the Pacific Islands and particularly Samoa, where he settled in 1890. 

In this class, we will explore the many sides of this remarkable career by looking at the connections between the author’s Scottish and Pacific fiction. The works we will read are the great adventure story Kidnapped (1886), the modernist romance ‘The Beach of Falesa’ (1892), and the existential thriller The Ebb-Tide (1894). We will also read important secondary interpretations of Stevenson’s work as well as introductory texts about Scottish and Pacific history. 

I hope that by taking this class, students will gain an introduction to Stevenson’s work and his world, and in so doing they will also discover the close relationship between history and fiction.
