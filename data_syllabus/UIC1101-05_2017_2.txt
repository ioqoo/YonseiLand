In the Freshman Writing Intensive Seminar (FWIS) you will build and refine crucial self-assessment skills that will allow you to become a better academic writer and reader. Throughout the semester, you will be given opportunities to practice important writing techniques that prioritize clarity and effective delivery. In effect, the course will offer instruction on how to construct highly readable sentences and paragraphs that communicate the right or intended message to the reader.

You will first work towards gaining better critical abilities in recognizing whether a text - including your own - coheres or not. You will achieve this through continued reading and through regular workshops, which will expose you to examples and objects for collaborative study. In time, you will focus on shaping your sentences and paragraphs into argumentative structures by imbuing them with meaning and direction. You will learn to write in a way that is not only clear, but demonstrates purpose and deliberate ideas.
