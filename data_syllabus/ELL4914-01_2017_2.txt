This course will take seriously the notion of “the contemporary” as that which coexists with us and is relevant to our times or our spaces. It will provide a look into the variegated landscape of twenty-first century English and American literature. 
It emphasizes how current political and social issues such as racial justice, the rise of the war on terror, and technological advancements in fields like genetic engineering influence literary production in English. All the works on the syllabus have been published in the past ten years. We will start with the Nobel laureate Toni Morrison’s Home (2012), which looks at African American involvement in the Korean War. Then we will move on to Mohsin Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist (2007), which is called a 9/11 novel by reviewers, and look at how the “War on Terror” is represented in the text. We will finish the course with Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go (2005), which uses the genre of science fiction to imagine the influence of developments in cloning on human life. These works enable us to reengage with our present with a sense of wonder and critical sophistication that contemporary fiction is adept at providing. The aim of the course is to provoke interest in and further queries on the relations between politics and culture.
