This course introduces students to philosophical thoughts, with a
particular emphasis on philosophical argumentation. We will \emph{not}
aim to survey great thinkers` ideas. Instead, we will choose  a few
important philosophical questions, and try to work our way through
them. The topics are drawn from the three main areas of philosophy:
moral philosophy, metaphysics, and epistemology. The questions we will discuss include: 

Can there be objective standard of right and wrong? What could be the standards? 
Can we ever prove the existence of god? If there is no conclusive evidence for it, can it be still rational to believe in god? 
What is knowledge? Can we really know anything about the
  external world? 
What is the criterion of personal identity? Can we survive our
  bodily death?

Along the way, we will learn many basic philosophical concepts and
principles too.
