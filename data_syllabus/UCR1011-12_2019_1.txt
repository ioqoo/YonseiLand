The course is taught in English, and all materials are in English. I also expect that when you are sitting in my classroom (even before class or discussion has started) that you are speaking English. For me, English is a way for people from multiple ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds to communicate in a shared space without social distinction. Private conversations in a language other than English unintentionally create barriers between students.
