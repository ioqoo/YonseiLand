The course aims to provide to the students with fundamental understanding of entrepreneurship. In five years time, I want you to remember, that we all have the ability to come up with ideas, and that we can turn these ideas into an income, but that this is not an easy process. Even though itâ€™s not easy I want you to be able to see entrepreneurial opportunities and have the understanding of how to get started.  With this class I cannot turn you in to a billionaire (if I could I would), but I can help you improve your chances by teaching you about the fundamentals of entrepreneurships, the common mistakes, and how to improve our chances of success. 

The course is taught through a series of readings, case studies, exercises, and a course project, so that you will experience ? rather than simply be exposed to ? many of the tradeoffs involved, and their implications for developing new business opportunities.  We will make good use of case discussions. In many of the classes we will spend a time discussing the assigned case. This is an interactive process: We seek to get multiple viewpoints and perspectives on the table, which should be defended through rigorous reasoning. This is very insightful and interesting. 

By the end of the course, students should have a clear understanding of how to go from raw ideas to product, service or business concepts through the process of identifying, refining and screening opportunities, and should be well poised to take the next steps to designing and successfully launching a new product, service, or business.
