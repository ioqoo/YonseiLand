The primary purpose of this course is to analyze the formulation and solution 
of representative problems that arise in the physical sciences and are modeled 
by differential equations. In this course, we begin with studying ordinary 
differential equations and their application including modeling. Next, we 
study systems of differential equations which occur in various applications. 
We also study Legendre`s equation, Bessel`s equation, and Laplace transforms.
