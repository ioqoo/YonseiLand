This course aims students to have reading capability of classical chinese 

literature. Students will be asked to read and translate classical chinese 

sentences into modern languages at the final exam. In addition the lecture 

will be focused on understanding common culture of the past in East Asia. 

Although this course is basically designed for Korean students whose first 

language is Korean, international students who are interested in reading 

classical chinese are encouraged to join the class. Korean will be spoken in 

most lectures and discussions, however, translation of classical chinese at 

the final exam can be made in modern Korean, Chinese, Japanese or English. It 

is preferable for international students to contact with the professor before 

attending the lecture.
