This course deals with the history of Japanese empire from 1868 to 1945. Japanese empire has been understood in a way that the complexity of interplays between Japan and its colonies is ignored. Public memories of the Japanese empire have still been constructed and reproduced within such a simple binary framework as oppression vs. resistance, or progress vs. deterioration.
This class seeks for a more comprehensive understanding of the nature and significance of the whole Japanese empire, firstly, by paying attention to Japanese ideas of empire and imperial institutions, and secondly by focusing on the transformation of their colonies. Japanese political leaders did not conceive and implement their policy towards colonies in a vacuum; they did so based on a certain set of ideas. This course stresses the ideational and discursive fields in which Japanese policymakers operated. Those fields were built by their concept of empire, Asia and the Western civilization. This course also emphasizes the colonial developments within the Japanese empire. Using the case of Korea, it tries to capture the interactions between colonizers and the colonized in those developments, more specifically, their negotiation, struggle, collaboration, and resistance. And those interactions include inequalities as well as complexities, tensions, and ambiguities. 
To reach a deeper understanding of the history of Japanese empire, we will explore primary sources as well as the secondary literature providing a critical analysis of them. We will seek to answer such questions as: What kinds of shared, competing, contradicting, and compromised ideas of empire emerged and evolved in the era of Japanese empire?  How were the Japanese empire and its colonies, especially, Korea, transformed in the period and how can we assess the colonial development from the historical perspective? 
The early part of classes will consist of lectures and the latter part of classes will be comprised of discussion sessions.
