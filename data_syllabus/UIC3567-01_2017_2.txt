The First World War has been called "the seminal catastrophe of the twentieth century." Though traditionally accounts of this conflict have been dominated by the experience of the Western Front, this seminar will go beyond the trenches and examine the conflict from a global perspective. After beginning with a survey of the war`s origins and outbreak, we will analyze the impact of the war on Africa, the Middle East, East Asia and Russia, as well as the experience of European civilians and soldiers, and will conclude with a discussion of the war`s aftermath. We will read and discuss primary source documents such as diplomatic correspondence, political speeches, oral histories, eyewitness accounts, propaganda posters, cartoons, memoirs, novels, poetry, and film. We will supplement these discussions with a wide variety of secondary sources that approach the conflict from the perspectives of military, political, social, economic, cultural and environmental history.

The course is taught in English, and all materials are in English. I also expect that when you are sitting in my classroom (even before class or discussion has started) that you are speaking English. For me, English is a way for people from multiple ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds to communicate in a shared space without social distinction. Private conversations in a language other than English unintentionally create barriers between students.
