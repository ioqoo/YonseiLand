The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the concepts and 
principles used in the modern treatment of solids. It begins with the 
fundamentals of quantum physics, since the textbook tends to assume a 
familiarity with quantum theory, particularly the Schrodinger equation. 
Main topics include: crystal structures, phonons, free electron model, and 
energy bands, which are of great importance in understanding semiconductors, 
magnetic materials, and superconductors.

HOMEWORK
Assignments from your textbook or references relevant to our lectures will be 
collected in class at every two weeks. These problems are assigned to help you 
learn. So, if you attempt to turn in work not of your own thoughts and 
efforts, you will suffer at exam time.
ANNOUNCEMENTS
All lectures will be given in English. Also, homework, exams and presentation 
have to be done in English. Remember that there is no exception to this rule. 
This is a tough course even if it is graded generously.
