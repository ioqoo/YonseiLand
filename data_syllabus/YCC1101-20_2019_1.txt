This course is an integrated two-credit blended learning format designed to improve academic listening and speaking for students at the intermediate level. The course will be divided into two main parts with four major threads weaving throughout; climate change and building and ecological civilization are the two parts, and the threads are: climate science, climate solutions, ecological civilization and finding and living one`s dream.  The first half of the semester will be spent on studying climate science and solutions.  The second half of the semester will be devoted to the study of building an ecological civilization - however that manifests.  A major theme of the course is for you to learn how to effectively give good presentations using your platform of choice (PPT, Keynote, or PreziNext), and you will be expected to apply this knowledge and skill in preparation for your assignments and exams.  To encourage motivation and offer practice listening and speaking, students are assigned a variety of activities and graded assignments that include a role play and games.  Complementing these is one major listening quiz, enabling you to study for it in advance.  Finally, time permitting, we will learn about and practice Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (M.B.S.R.) and, time permitting, Nonviolent Communication (NVC).  Some Extra Credit will be available throughout the course.
