In this course, we will study the writings of Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), who is widely regarded as one of the most influential and important,
but also controversial, philosophers of the twentieth century.  We will focus on representative texts from the various periods of his philosophical 
career, including the Introduction to Being and Time, What is Metaphysics?, Letter on Humanism, the Origin of the Work of Art, and the Question 
concerning Technology. All texts will be read in English translation.
