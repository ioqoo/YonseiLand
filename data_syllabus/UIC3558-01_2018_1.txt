American Pastoral

This course is concerned with inflections of the pastoral (or anti-pastoral) in American literature. Starting with William Empson`s definition of the pastoral process 
as "putting the complex in the simple," we will examine the ways in which American writers, from Washington Irving to Cormac McCarthy, have addressed the 
relationship between human beings and nature. Of particular interest will be the extent to which nature reflects human feeling, the literary figures used to forge or 
interrogate this relation, and the question of (American) innocence and violence.
