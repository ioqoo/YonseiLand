Mental illness remains one of the most elusive and neglected topics in Korean history.  As in most Asian countries, severe social ostracism, shame, and fear of jeopardizing marriage prospects induce families to conceal the mentally ill behind closed doors.  In the most recent survey completed in 2014, South Korea still has the highest suicide rate of 29.1 per 100,000 people among member nations of the OECD, eclipsing Hungary and Japan.  Sociologists and psychiatrists have attributed this sudden spate of suicides as a by-product of South Korea’s breakneck industrialization, which has created enormous expectations and pressures to succeed in this hyper-competitive society, but at the same time “left an especially large crack that the poor and disabled populations slip through even more often. Despite the alarming suicide statistics, the South Korean government has yet to fund significant studies to “identify key stressors and supports in the individual’s social environment.”

The term bibliotherapy was first coined in 1916 and became popularized in the 1960s in the United States as a therapeutic program designed to facilitate the recovery of patients suffering from mental illness or emotional disturbances. This course seeks to find ways to use webtoons as a corrective therapy for those undergoing emotional and behavioral disorders. Drawing on a wide range of texts incorporating psychotherapy, counselling psychology, and literary studies, students will select effective texts for bibliotherapeutic work, analyze target groups, conduct evaluations, and specify the therapeutic aims.
