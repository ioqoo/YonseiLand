##
the goal of this class is to gain the basic theory and application of robust 
control. The class covers mainly two types of problems.
- Analysis problems: determine if the controlled signals satisfy the desired 
properties for all admissible noises, disturbances, and model uncertainties.
-Synthesis problems: Design a controller so that the controlled signals 
satisfy the desired properties for all admissible noises, disturbances, and 
model uncertainties.
