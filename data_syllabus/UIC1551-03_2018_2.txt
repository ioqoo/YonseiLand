World History: Britain and the World since 1750

British history in the last 250 years has been synonymous with some of the major changes experienced around the globe. With the fallout from the 2016 Brexit referendum Britain once again seems to be a measure of the world’s turbulence. But how did the small island of Britain become so influential, and what has been its relationship with the rest of the world in modern times? How have the interactions between Britain and the world shaped the world in which we live today? The aim of this course is to provide students with the opportunity to explore these important questions through historical materials and methods. 

In studying this broad theme through lectures, readings, discussions, and group work, we will explore a variety of topics, including the changing political relationship between elites and masses, the impact of technology on the economy and social life, the tensions and compatibilities between nationalism and imperialism, and the divergences between scientific and non-scientific views of the world. Historical topics we will be covering include the American Revolution, the Atlantic slave trade, the Industrial Revolution, British imperial entanglements in India and China, World War, decolonization, and Britain’s relations with Europe.

The design of this class integrates content learning with the acquisition of skills. I hope that by the end of the class, students will gain a better understanding of the ways in which history can inform the way we think about the present, and will have the confidence to be able to apply the skills that they have acquired in a wider context.
