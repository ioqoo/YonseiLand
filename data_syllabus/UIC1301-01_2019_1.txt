What makes a work of literature “modern” or “modernist”? What are the distinguishing social, cultural, and political features of the historical period we call the modern era (or “modernity”), and what are the defining qualities of the art we consider exemplary of this period? These will be the guiding questions of this course. 

In the first half of the semester, we will focus on two key novels from the 19th and 20th century, respectively: Madame Bovary, by the French writer Gustave Flaubert, and Mrs. Dalloway by the English writer Virginia Woolf. As we read these texts, we will think about why the novel is the narrative form most closely identified with modernity and explore how it represents experience and constructs subjectivity. At the same time, we will consider the historical specificity of the characters and plot in our two novels?that is, the ways they reflect new conditions of life. In the second half of the semester, we will investigate the “dark side” of modernity, as expressed in poetry by the French writer Charles Baudelaire, short stories by the Czech-German (Bohemian) writer Franz Kafka, and in cinema by the German director Leni Riefenstahl: an idea of modernity as defined by the loss?but also, potentially, restoration?of tradition, values, innocence, community, certainty, a sense of history, a natural relation to the body, and so on. We will encounter some of the useful critical perspectives that emerge from this framework, while also discussing how it underpins the ideology of fascism.
