Modern mainstream economics and/or econometrics take mathematical approaches to address economic problems formally and analyze them precisely. As the emphasis on mathematical approaches have been put very heavily in the field of economics, it is now very difficult for students without knowledge on mathematics to study further advanced economics and/or econometrics courses. Therefore, the main goal of Mathematics for Economics is in providing students studying in the field of economics with the basic ideas on mathematical approaches which have been frequently used for economics and/or econometrics. Specifically, students are expected to be able to do the following by taking 
Mathematics for Economics :
  - Understand economic and/or econometric problems associated with mathematics without much difficulty, when taking other economics and/or 
econometrics courses;
  - Begin to think of economic and/or econometric problems by rigorous mathematical formalization and analysis.
