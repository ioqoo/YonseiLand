This course provides a broad survey of major events and developments in the history of western civilization from classical antiquity through its decline in post colonialism. Major themes covered include the rise and fall of governments and empires, the evolution of cultures and society, philosophy, art, economics, and commerce, and in the end, the globalization of the West. While surveying 6000 years of history is quite challenging, we shall centre our study on the ways in which different periods of western civilization address timeless questions on the "progress" of the human condition. In doing so, this course disentangles transitional moments in the progress of western intellectual culture through survey lectures, focused-in-class case studies, excerpts from influential primary source manuscripts, and accessible secondary literature offered in the course reader. Upon completing this course students will have a familiarity with prominent figures, events and developments in western civilization and have demonstrated the above knowledge by way of midterm and final examination
