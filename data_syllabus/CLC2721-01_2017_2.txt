This course covers the history of Hollywood cinema of the last 100 years and 
examines its artistic content and contemporary cultural and social roles; ideally, 
it serves to develop your general intellectual capacities of the film industry. 

 Following a loose chronology, we`ll study the origin, development, and growth of 
Hollywood cinema from a variety of perspectives (e.g. social, cultural, global, 
technological and artistic standpoints) and discuss the evolution of specific 
trends, styles, and issues related to the Hollywood film industry. The course also 
outlines the history of the world cinema to illustrate its impact and influence on 
Hollywood and vice versa.  

By evaluating selected works that comprise each genre and a certain time period, 
not only do we trace the history of Hollywood cinema but its relationship to 
global popular culture, historical representation, and other mass media outlets, 
such as the music industry, TV, and advertising.
