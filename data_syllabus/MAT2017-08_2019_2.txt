We study Fourier analysis and basic partial differential equations of engineering. Fourier analysis has basic applications related to boundary initial value problems of mechanics, heat flow, and other fields. Many egineering problems can be modeled and solved by functions of a complex variables in order to solve such complicated problems in heat conduction, fluid flow,  electrostatics, etc
