Thermodynamics is one of the oldest sciences in human history and has been a hotbed for many important physical and engineering applications. 
Understanding thermodynamic concepts is therefore essential, even in the distant branch of science. 
In modern era, thermodynamics has moreover become more attractive than ever, thanks to its critical role in the emerging technologies such as energy and environment science, bioengineering, biomedicine, and nanotechnology. 
In this course to lay out the thermodynamic foundations for future research, 
we study the fundamentals of thermodynamics including the first and second law of thermodynamics in terms of work, energy and entropy.
