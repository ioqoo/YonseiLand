The purpose of this course is to help students to learn basic Hanja(漢字) vocabularies and improve their academic Korean language skills. As this course is designed for beginners, students with good proficiency in Hanja are not allowed to take this course. Classes will mostly consist of lectures. On the top of that, learning and practicing writing Hanja correctly will be another important part of this course. There will be three in-class examinations; two midterms and the final. Lectures will be based mainly, but not exclusively, on materials in the main text book, 『대학생이 알아야 할 한자』. 

The course has no specific prerequisites.(beginners only!!)
