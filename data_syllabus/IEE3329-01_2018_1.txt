Culture and Cognition (C&C) will provide students with an opportunity to understand human cognition and information processing in the context of our ways of living in the society. C&C covers a wide range of cognition such as perception, attention, memory, language and its applications to our living context. In other words, students will learn important concepts and issues regarding human cognition and the human brain, and how they are affected by and adapts to particular cultures. Note that C&C does not focus on cultural differences such as individualism vs. collectivism. It rather focuses on discussing how our cognition and brain are influenced by, changes in, or interacts with our living contexts. My hope is that students will become more attentive to and observant of the ways of their living and be able to translate their observations into psychological terms and concepts by the end of the semester.
