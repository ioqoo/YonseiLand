This course is a general survey of the field of cultural psychology. Although 
a broad range of subjects is sampled, the primary focus is to examine cross-
cultual differences in cognition, emotion, and behavior between European 
Americans and East Asians. In specific, the course will 
survey how differently individuals feel, think, and behave as a function of 
culture.
