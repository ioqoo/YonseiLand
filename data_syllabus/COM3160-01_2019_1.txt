The course will critically evaluate rock music`s musical content and contemporary cultural and social roles; ideally, the course serves to develop your general intellectual capacities of the music industry from the 1950s to 1960s (the so-called "rock and roll" era, arguably the most turbulent yet important period in popular music history).

It`s NOT a music course, per se, but we will be listening to a lot of music as we consider the effects of recorded sound on popular culture. Thus, this is the quintessential "media and culture" course, and that`s why it is offered by College of Communication, not Dept. of Music. 

We`ll study the origin and growth of the recording industry and music business, consider the impact new technology had (and continues to have) on the development of popular music and examine the mutual influence between rock music and other media (film, television, radio, etc.).

Following a loose chronology, we will begin with an introduction to listening and some musical fundamentals, gradually developing a vocabulary with which to discuss and experience selected works from the history of rock. We trace the evolution of specific musical styles and investigate issues related to culture, performance, technology, and reception. 

Reading assignments will introduce the distinct musical styles, performers, and works that comprise each genre and a certain time period. They also cover the relationship of rock music to American and global popular culture, historical representation, and authenticity.
