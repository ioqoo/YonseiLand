Syllabus_Korean
##
This course aims to familiarize the student with modern Korean literature, 
history, culture, and society of the 20th and early 21st century.. Classes consist of lecture, historical and 
literary readings, and film. As the main objective is an understanding of 
patterns of behavior and thought, the course content will be weighted more 
toward readings in literature than in history.

Classes will be structured around lecture, small group discussion, and class discussion.
