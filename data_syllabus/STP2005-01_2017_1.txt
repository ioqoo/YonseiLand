The way we experience things and materials can hardly be considered raw or direct. We do not experience them “directly” as they are in their “natural states.” Nor do we experience them as they exist independently of our acting on them. Things and materials are thickly covered with complex and multiple meanings through institutional, cultural, and political processes. Thus, the “nature” of things and materials are as much determined by aesthetic, symbolic, economic, and ritualistic values as by their physical characteristics. And we constantly participate in those various processes of creating, changing, challenging, and negotiating the social meanings of things.
This course will explore themes such as social meanings of materiality, power relations involved in material culture, and the problem of agency and alienation manifested in human-material relations, with special focus on social mechanisms through which materials acquire and lose values. Also, we will discuss the new kinds of environmental disasters having emerged in the context of fundamental change in human-material relationship due to excessive production/consumption/disposal that was made possible in the fossil fuel economy.
