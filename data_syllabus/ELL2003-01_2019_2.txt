By the end of this course, each student will succeed in writing a research paper using multiple sources to do literary analysis. 
The course is structured to get you to that point. 
You can`t write about literature unless you know how to read and understand what you`re reading. 
Hence the first half of the semester is focused on how to do close reading using short stories by various writers reflecting diverse styles. 
This will also allow us to gain fresh understanding of literary elements while learning to observe facts and details about how the text is working. 
In the second half, you will write a research paper on a short story of your choice, learning to participate in an academic conversation with both peers and scholars by engaging with, responding to, incorporating and appropriately attributing the ideas of others.
