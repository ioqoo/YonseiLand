In the world of information technology, it seems like change is the only constant. In less than a human lifetime, this technological torrent has transformed virtually every facet of our society ? and the transformation is just beginning. Even though the computer and the Internet are among the most important inventions of our era, but few people know what computer is and what it can (and cannot) do. This course is to illustrate the basics of information technology and how computers and networks are used to as practical tools.
A deeper understanding of information technology will help you answer much more meaningful questions. For example, Will automation result in massive, long-term unemployment? Will information technology be a tool to bring the people of the world closer together, or will it divide a permanent wedge between the rich and the poor?
