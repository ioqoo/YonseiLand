This course mainly focuses on economic analysis in terms of welfare. That is, we study how to evaluate the market allocations based on efficiency, how to achieve efficient allocations through the market, and when the market fails in achieving efficient allocations. First, we study market structure besides the competitive market such as standard monopoly (uniform pricing), monopoly behavior (price discrimination) and oligopoly (basic concepts in game theory are also covered). Second, we consider exchange, production, welfare, social choice (voting rules are mainly investigated), and externalities (If time allows). 

This course will emphasize the development of microeconomic models to analyze economic decision-making of agents. It will endow the students with the basic toolkit of microeconomic theory and prepare them to take more advanced courses of economics.
