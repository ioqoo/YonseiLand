The purpose of this course is to help students to learn basic Hanja(漢字) vocabularies and improve their academic Korean language skills. As this course is designed for beginners, students with good proficiency in Hanja are not allowed to take this course. Classes will mostly consist of lectures. There will be in-class midterm and final examinations, two in-class quizes. Lectures will be based mainly, but not exclusively, on materials in the main text book, 『대학생이 알아야 할 한자』. 

The course has no specific prerequisites.(beginners only!!)
