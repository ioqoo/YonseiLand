This course is designed to introduce students to the methodology of survey research. We will consider all practical aspects of survey research and polling, from sampling to questionnaire design to methods of data collection to data analysis. The goal of the class is to give you an introduction to every major topic so you can become a well-informed consumer of surveys. By the end of the semester you will not be expert at everything, but you will learn enough to ask the right questions. Students interested in pursuing survey research are strongly encouraged to take additional classes on statistics and public opinion.
