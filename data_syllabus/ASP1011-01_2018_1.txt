In this gateway course to the Asian Studies major/minor, we begin by examining how the “Orient” came to be (re-)imagined, starting in the 19th century, via concepts, practices, and visual cues that we associate with the modern. We will look at how East Asian intellectuals reconceived of time, space, and sovereignty in ways that presented a very different view of China/Japan/Korea, and of Asia’s place in the world, a view that established Asia’s “backward” status in relation to the “West.” We will then examine Japan’s brief (but dramatic) challenge to Euro-American dominance in the Asia-Pacific War. We will consider how Allied victory, and Japan’s surrender to the United States, laid the basis for not just the Cold War but also the “history wars” that shape the terrain on which political conflict is waged within South Korea and Japan, but also between China, Japan, Korea, and the United States. The overall aim of the course is to introduce students to critical scholarship about the historical and epistemological conditions that determine how Asia (specifically China, Japan, and Korea) was, and is, represented, perceived, and understood.
