Friedrich Schelling (1774-1854)is one of the three major philosophers 
identified with German Idealism: taking his departure, like Fichte and then 
Hegel, from Kant`s "Copernican revolution" in philosophy, he would contribute 
to what is widely regarded as one of the most exciting and fertile periods of 
intellectual history. While Schelling rose to sudden fame at the beginning of 
his career, he would find himself, later on in life, overshadowed by Hegel. 
Partly this has to do with the fact that his philosophical position was 
constantly evolving and changing, with him producing a succession of 
different, often somewhat fragmentary, systems. Recent years, however, have 
seen a renewed interest in Schelling, and have gained a far greater 
appreciation for the profound originality, and radicality, of his thought.
The aim of this course is the study the philosophy of Schelling, in the 
context of German Idealism, through a study of several representative texts.
