From the ancient Greek and Chinese oracles and Taemong of Korea to the sofas 
of Freud and Jung to contemporary Yanomami shamans and Hollywood "Dreamworks," 
throughout a vast array of cultures and eras, dreams have been a source of 
inspiration, healing and insight. In this course we aim to reconnect with the 
imaginative and therapeutic power of dreams primarily through writing our own, 
while reading extensively in dream literature.
