This course aims at improving students` ability of critical reasoning. We will try to achieve this by systematically studying arguments, which may be thought as linguistic counterparts of reasoning. We will learn how to discern different types of arguments, and how to evaluate them. The field of study we cover in the course belongs to logic, which may be defined as the systematic study of arguments. Logic, in turn, properly belongs to philosophy. So our course will be philosophical in nature. We will very often ask why certain arguments are good, rather than taking certain rules of arguments for granted.
