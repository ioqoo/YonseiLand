Culture and Cognition (C&C) will provide students with an opportunity to 
understand human cognition and information processing in the context of our 
ways of living in the society. C&C covers a wide range of cognition such as 
perception, attention, memory, language and applies it to our living context. 
In other words, students will learn important concepts and issues regarding 
human cognition, and how human cognition is affected by and adapts to 
particular cultures. Note that C&C does not focus on cultural differences such 
as individualism vs. collectivism. It rather focuses on discussing how our 
cognition is influenced by, changes in, or interacts with our living contexts. 
My hope is that students will become more attentive to and observant of the 
wys of their living and be able to translate their observations into 
psychological terms and concepts by the end of the semester.
