As introduction to the course, we begin with a critical look at how North Korea becomes legible and visible to us. What seems like propaganda, what seems like the “real” North Korea, and why? 

As historical backdrop, necessary but not sufficient for understanding North Korea today, we will take a brief look at North Korea when it was part of the socialist world. Starting with North Korea’s revolutionary transformation prior to the Korean War, we will consider how North Korean history can be understood apart from the story of Kim Il Sung and his family. 

We then examine the more recent past: that is, North Korea in the post-socialist world, the famine that killed so many in the mid-/late 1990s, and contemporary issues related to peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula.
