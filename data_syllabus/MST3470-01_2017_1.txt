This coursework provides the fundamental understandings of the mechanical 
properties of materials based on solid mechanics. You will learn the basic 
concepts of force, displacement, stress,and strain. Based on these concepts, 
you will study the elastic and plastic behaviors of materials due to the 
stresses and defects in materials such as pores and dislocations.

This coursework provides the fundamental understandings of the mechanical 
behavior of materials based on solid mechanics. You will study the basic 
concept of force, displacement, stress, strain and vetor and tensor notations. 
Based on these concepts, the elastic and plastic behavior of materials due to 
the stresses by stretching, bending, torsion, and buckling will be studied.
