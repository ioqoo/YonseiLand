The purpose of this course is to examine South Koreaâ€™s strategic thinking and policy-making capacities in the field of sustainable development. As a case study, the course will review various theoretical and practical issues related to South Korea`s Green Growth strategy and sustainable development policy and diplomacy, such as: nonconventional challenges to the Korean economy and environment; institutionalization of the national sustainable development strategy; global leadership as a middle power; and official development assistance (ODA) and international collaboration on sustainable development. This course will also explore various political and socioeconomic issue areas -- such as biodiversity, climate change, energy, environment, food and agriculture, health and disease, natural disaster, technology, urbanization and population, and water resources -- in which middle powers like South Korea play a role in global sustainable development.
