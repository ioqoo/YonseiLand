The main objective of this course is to understand the basic theories and 
principles regarding mechanical behaviors of various structures using 
structural analysis techniques. The expected skills which will be acquired in 
this course are to get comprehensive understanding of mechanical behaviors of 
various types of structures and apply computational techniques to structural 
analysis.

This course is designed for senior students of Civil and Environmental 
Engineering. The course covers the analysis methods for statically determinate 
and indeterminate structures. Analysis methods for various types of structures 
such as trusses, beams, and frames will be discussed in the class. In the 
first half of the semester, this course will be more focused on the various 
fundamental structural Analysis methods. During the last half of the semester, 
the lectures will introduce computational approaches based on Matrix analysis 
and commercial softwares using Finite Element Method as known as FEM.
