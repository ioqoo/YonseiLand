This course provides an introduction to the study of narrative. We start with the premise
that short stories and novels are modes of thought with which writers and readers have
engaged with the world for centuries. Works of fiction tell stories that are continuously
being reimagined and rewritten. As readers, we are engaged in the project of rewriting,
finding new ways to relate fiction to our lives, connect with it, and make it meaningful to 
ourselves and others. In this course, students will develop a solid understanding of a
few key ideas about how narrative works and a vocabulary for describing it.
Lectures and discussion will attend not only to close readings of selected works of 
fiction, but also engage with questions about what literature is and what we do when
we read and write about it.
