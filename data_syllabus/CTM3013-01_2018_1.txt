After the brief overview of fundamentals of economics, we will cover various topics including (1) dynamic process of innovation and corporate strategy such as disruptive innovation, vertical integration vs. modularization, learning curve, and determinants of R&D intensity; (2) success and failure of innovative activities; (3) utilization issues of innovation output including first-mover advantage, battles for winner-take-all, patents and standards.
