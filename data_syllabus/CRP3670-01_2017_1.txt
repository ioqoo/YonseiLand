Cities are complex entities that display particular dynamics of, and resistances to, change. Against the backdrop of imminent resource limits and rapidly changing global ecosystems, it has become essential for urban planners and other stakeholders to foster an urban transition towards sustainability. Yet, this requires the capacity to understand and effectively influence the complex systemic configuration of cities.
Especially with a view to calls for urban transformation and ‘Smart City’ development as articulated e.g. in the UN 2030 Agenda or HABITAT III, actors in the public, private and civil society sectors must be able to proficiently engage with the interdependency between the technological and social characteristics of urban areas.
Therefore, this course introduces to socio-technical systems (STS) theory and its application to cities and urban development as a crucial perspective to inform sustainability-oriented policy, planning and research. It will be dedicated to explore the theoretical foundations for understanding urban STS, and to review examples for applying this perspective to the analysis of and/or intervention in various domains (e.g. energy, water, waste, mobility, housing, green infrastructure, ICT). 

Goal:
Through selected readings, targeted analysis, group discussions, and empirical case study, students will have the opportunity to deepen their understanding of socio-technical systems and their vital importance for guiding urban change towards sustainability.
