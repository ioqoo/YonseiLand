In this course, we will read select works by some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful contemporary Japanese authors. We will begin with latest fiction by the globally bestselling Haruki Murakami and continue on with his younger contemporaries. Our inquiry will be twofold, i.e., content and form. What common thematic concerns of Japanese and/or global contemporaniety emerge among these works? What representational techniques and/or genre conventions serve those concerns most effectively? We will consider these works both individually and collectively.
