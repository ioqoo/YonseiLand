Organized like an upper division seminar, this course examines questions of belonging and exclusion in contemporary South Korean society, politics, and culture. We begin with three theoretical texts that will serve as comparative, political, and philosophical points of reference: Mary Beard’s Women & Power, Alain Badiou’s Ethics, and Wendy Brown’s Regulating Aversion. We then turn to specific topics: beauty, feminisms, and geopolitics; the system of gender and sexuality (with a quick look, for historical comparison, at male concubinage in late 19th century Chos?n); intercountry adoption in the time of empire; race/ethnicity, class, and transborder membership; and national security, conscientious objection, and peace activism. In the final part of the course, with instructor supervision and constructive feedback from peers, each student will pursue his or her own research project.
