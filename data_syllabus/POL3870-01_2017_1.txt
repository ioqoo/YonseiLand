Confronting the past and rendering justice are not an easy matter for any society.  It is also true in international politics.  Historian Charles Maier has lamented that “our current in capacity to entertain transformative political projects for the future and hence to invest our collective resources in contesting the past.”  The main goal of this course is to provide graduate students with opportunities to think about this problem and propose possible solutions.  
This course has three components. The first component regards the key conceptual tools and theories needed to examine reconciliation and justice in international politics. The second component regards the situations on the ground.  What are the main cases and issues?  What are the general trends in international relations with regards to addressing and redressing justice and reconciliation?  What kind of national and global efforts have been made in attempts to help solve them? The third component is drawing lessons and insights from specific cases in Asia, Europe and Africa. Why do some states promote particular historical narratives and policies?  What are the domestic and international consequences of their particular policy choices?  Can a country’s success story be emulated by another country? 
Class is conducted mainly in a seminar format and complemented discussions on current issues
