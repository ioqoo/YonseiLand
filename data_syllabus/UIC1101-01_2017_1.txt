This course seeks the intersection of creative communication and academic 
style. The essential questions: Which modes of communication can help shape 
modern thought? How can academic writing be imaginative and original? This 
ongoing inquiry will grow to include journalistic techniques, as well as 
creative nonfiction and its sub-genres: lyric essay, travel narrative, memoir, 
and cultural criticism. The broad search will begin with traditionally 
sanctioned forms of academic composition, then move on to include fiction, 
poetry, and digital communication. Writing formulas will be interrogated, not 
embraced. Time-honored principles of academic composition will be laid open 
to scrutiny. Study of a wide range of content will yield deeper, functional 
understanding of possibilities within the written form. The final product will 
be academic writing that acknowledges diversity and embraces personal style.

The Freshman Writing Intensive Seminar (FWIS) emphasizes written analysis of a 
wide range of texts. Specific aspects of writing emphasized in FWIS include the 
following:

* Style, Accuracy, and Clarity of Expression
 
* Thesis Development

* Textual Evidence

* Close Reading

* Organization

* Summary and Critique

* Formatting

* Awareness of Different Writing Contexts
