This course aims to provide you with the background and conceptual tools that are necessary to understand the problems and issues of world politics. In this course, you will be introduced to the wide range of issues that make up the study of world politics, including the causes of international conflict and violence, international economic relations, and politics related to human rights, foreign aid, etc. These issues will be analyzed using the basic elements of the study of world politics (i.e., actors, choices, preferences, and consequences of state interactions) and important mechanisms that underpin domestically (e.g., the role of democracy in explaining war) and internationally (e.g., the role of international institutions in explaining trade). The class is designed such that I lecture on Wednesday for two hours and students present their readings on Monday.
