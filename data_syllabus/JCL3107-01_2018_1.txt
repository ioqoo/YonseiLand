Contract law governs relationships that we deliberately enter into via a process of negotiation, offer, and acceptance, while tort law governs the relationships that we all share with each other simply by virtue of our participation in the same society.

In this course, we will explore both the law itself as well as the relationship between law and society. We will start by exploring the settled, black letter principles of the law--what the law actually says. Using those principles, we will get some practice at doing legal analysis--applying the law to hypothetical disputes. This will give students a sense of the laws that govern our daily lives, and some experience of what a traditional legal education is like. Then we will move into discussing the policy issues behind the law, and whether the law as it currently exists is effective for promoting human flourishing--which is (or at least should be) the ultimate goal of all our laws. Finally, we will consider how our relationships that are governed by law compare to those that are not, and what we can learn (in both directions, and both good and bad) from that comparison.

Target knowledge and skills to be developed:

- Introductory knowledge of tort and contract law
- Understanding of the relationship between law and society
- Basic legal and policy analysis
- Critical thinking and debate skills
- Clear and effective persuasive writing
