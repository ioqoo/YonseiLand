While challenging, Advanced students will not be given as much reading access as Honours students. In addition, less written work will be expected of Advanced students.

This course is designed to look at various world issues. To begin with women in the workplace, retirement and fertility will be looked at. After midterms, students will begin writing essays and prepare to attend seminars where they will lead and discuss the readings and materials completed in class.

Time considerations may allow a focus on a specialist subject. In the past have included; Putin and Russia, the revolt in Syria, Iran`s nuclear program, insurgents in Pakistan, insurgents in Afghanistan, insurgents in Central Asia, Iran`s domestic politics, India and China. 
Future classes will look at other topics of relevance but may well include Mali and Algeria, the Arab Spring in sum, Egypt and the Muslim Brotherhood, 
Libya, the US switch to the Asia-Pacific region, North Korea as well as East Asia in general. 
A region which may also be looked at is the Congo, where Africa`s `world war` took place and over 5 million people died but the world`s media paid very 
little attention. It would be very interesting to know why such an event was over-looked.
