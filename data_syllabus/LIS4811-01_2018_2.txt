Thecourseisdesignedtocoverresearch,development,andevaluationissuesinbig data in the context of social as well as biomedical interaction. In this course we explore key data analysis and management techniques, which applied to massive datasets are the cornerstone that enables real-time decision making in distributed environments, business intelligence in the Web, and scientific discovery at large scale. In particular, we examine the map-reduce parallel computing paradigm and associated technologies such as distributed file systems, no-sql databases, and stream computing engines. Additionally we review machine learning methods that make possible the efficient analysis of large volumes of data in near real time.
