Any product--whether a website, a technological system, or an electronically 
mediated service--benefits from evaluation before, during, and after the 
development cycle. Too often, the people who use a product cannot find what 
they want or accomplish what they need to do. Products are more successful 
when they are developed through a process that identifies how the products 
will be used, elicits input from potential users, and watches how the product 
function in real time with real users. This course provides a hands-on 
introduction to methods used throughout the entire evaluation process-from 
identifying the goals of the product, picturing who will use it, engaging 
users through a variety of formative evaluation techniques, and confirming a 
product`s function through usability testing and summative evaluation. 
Specific methods include personas and scenarios, competitive analysis, 
observation, surveys, interviews, data analysis, heuristic evaluation, 
usability testing, and diary studies. Students will work on group projects 
that apply these techniques to real products in use or development.
