This course will survey the history and civilization of Korea from 
prehistoric times to the late 19th century, when Korea opened its door to the  
world trade and diplomacy. This course aims at enhancing the student`s 
understanding of major topics and themes of pre-modern Korean history by 
introducing both Korean and Western scholarship on them. Attempts will be made 
to place traditional Korean history and culture in broader East Asian context, 
and to relate them to the modern changes.
