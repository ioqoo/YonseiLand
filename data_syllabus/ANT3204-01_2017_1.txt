This course is intended to understand the social changes from the positions of diverse groups since reform era in contemporary China. The class will aim to provide an anthropological perspective on the lives of modern Chinese against the structural systems of political leadership and economic policies. From Deng`s reform to today`s Xi regime, for instance, students will examine the differing positions of China`s leadership, particularly between neoliberalism and socialist conservatism. They will be able to comprehend the underlying significance of the Chinese government`s policies in terms of the CCP`s historical orientations and political tension. In addition, a reflection on the margins of China`s politics such as ethnic minority, overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Taiwan would illuminate the possibility of political transformation in the greater China.
