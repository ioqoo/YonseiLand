This is a lower division course that examines a wide range of literary works that fall under the category of “modern Chinese literature.” First and foremost, we will situate the political and cultural uses of the term “modernity” within the context of modern China, as “modernity” itself is already a contested and ever-evolving historical process globally. Aesthetically, we will perform close reading of many genres in the modern Chinese literary canon, alongside those texts that do not fit comfortably within the canon. They include literature written by realist and May Fourth writers (Lu Xun, Shen Congwen), intellectual writings (Hu Shi, Liang Qichao, Chen Duxiu), Romantic writers (Xu Zhimo, Yu Dafu), feminist writing (Ding Ling), socialist literature, scar literature, post-Mao fiction (Yu Hua), Taiwan modernist fiction (Bai Xianyong), and Hong Kong and Taiwan literature (Wong Bik-wan, Qiu Miaojin). We will interpret these literary genres through critical engagements with secondary texts and theoretical writings by critics who are concerned with issues of modernity, feminism, nationalism, colonialism, gender and sexuality, and other aspects that constitute the historical processes and social identities of modern China.
