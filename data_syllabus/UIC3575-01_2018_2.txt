The horrors of the twelve-year rule of the Nazi regime (1933-45) ? the Second World War, the murder of six million European Jews and the neologism, “genocide,” which it inspired ? have provided an ugly hallmark for the analysis of modern German history.  Historians have interpreted the century preceding the “Third Reich” and the post-war period through the lenses of German fascism and the Holocaust.  However, the collapse of the German Democratic Republic and German (re-)unification in 1990 created havoc with many historical narratives of modern Germany.  The new Germany and the relative success of the European Union have re-shaped settled interpretations of the past.  As Germans, and their observers, look forward ? with optimism, resignation, or pessimism ? to an inscrutable future, their interpretations of the recent past become that much more divisive.
