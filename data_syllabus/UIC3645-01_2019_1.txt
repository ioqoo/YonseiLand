LIBERALISM IN NINETEENTH CENTURY BRITAIN

Liberalism, founded on claims about individual rights, free economic interactions, and theories of human progress, is one of the key modern ideologies, having profoundly shaped our understanding of ourselves and our social relationships. This course assesses the development and impact of liberalism in one of its main laboratories, nineteenth century Britain, by looking at how thinkers associated with liberalism engaged with the major issues of the day. Those issues were interconnected, and ranged from political freedom and economic organization to religion, empire, and womenâ€™s place in society. We will study a variety of readings, from philosophical treatises and parliamentary speeches to popular journalism and important secondary interpretations, in order to understand the debates in which liberal theories were challenged and developed. 

This seminar is an introduction to the practice of intellectual history and assignments will take the form of presentations, regular response papers, and a final research paper. I hope that by taking the class, students will gain deeper insight into contemporary political and social debates and equip themselves with the tools and knowledge to better articulate their positions.
