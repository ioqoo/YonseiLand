This course is dedicated to improving students’ academic writing. To this end, students will familiarize themselves with new writing skills each week, applying them to both their shorter writing exercises and term papers. Since good academic writing starts from critical attention to primary texts, we will also be examining a wide range of “objects” from photography, journalism, film, and fiction, attending to the specific analytical tools called for by each medium. We will principally focus on the question of time and space--how are they represented in our primary objects of discussion and what significance do temporal and spatial categories have for different theorists? Students are expected to engage with these questions in class discussions and effectively communicate their thoughts in written form.
