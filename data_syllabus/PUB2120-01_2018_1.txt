This course is intended to introduce fundamental concepts and framework for understanding how recent changes in state governance affect democracy, and vice versa. It will examine theoretical and empirical implications of various types of ‘old’ and ‘new’ governance with special attention to Korean cases. To be more specific, a series of lectures will offer a survey of major institutions, actors, and decision-making process of multiple governance systems. Ultimately, students will gain not only comprehensive knowledge of what constitute ‘good’ governance and democracy, but also critical thinking skills to make a policy brief which will be especially helpful for those who plan to work in the (quasi-) public sector.
