“Designing Playable Cities : Game Design in the Urban Context”
Context mapping is a qualitative design research approach that invites 
contextually aggregated data, owners of the data, and actors to innovative 
design spaces. It has originally evolved for designing and developing 
innovative products and services in a co-creative design process, while 
it critically focuses on user experiences embedded in the everyday life. 
The approach is seamlessly linked to the idea of the living lab, the 
emerging new research technique for designing IoT. By the generative 
techniques of context mapping, we could facilitate a living lab setting 
more relevant and organic. 

In the 2017 fall semester, Context mapping class will look into the field of 
urban digital experience that is effectively conceptualized by game design 
technologies, and social interaction frameworks. The prior knowledge 
on basic 3D and game engine are essentially positive to comprehend the 
coursework and homework.
