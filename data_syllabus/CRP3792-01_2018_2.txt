The goal of the course is to provide students with a basic understanding of urban safety and disaster planning/management. This general goal will be pursued through three themes:  a) identifying emergencies, disasters, and catastrophes; b) tracking historical changes in how disasters have been managed; and c) examining the four phases of the disaster management cycle (preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery).
