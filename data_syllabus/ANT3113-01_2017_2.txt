고 있다.  한 학기 동안 학생들은 visual media 가 어떻게 Field work의 방법론이자, 독립적인 연구영역으로 발전하게 되었는지 이해하고, 특히 한국 사회에서 디지털 영상 생산물이 대중적으로 활용되는 영역을 넓혀가면서 다큐멘터리 영상 제작과 다양하게 만나는 지점을 공부하게 될 것이다. 스튜디오와 이론 병행 수업으로서 다큐멘터리 영상을 제작하고 나누는 과정을 통해 1인 미디어 제작/편집의 기초적 능력을 갖추며, 자신이 만들어낸 narrative를 분석하고 다른 이들과 나누는 것을 배운다.

Syllabus in English : 

Digital Video as an Ethnographic Media





Course Objectives



This is a class designed to introduce students to the medium of video, a mode 

of ethnography, to deepen their understanding of documentary production as 

both creative art and social praxis. Students will learn basic skills in 

camera work, lighting, sound recording and editing and non-linear (digital) 

editing, and also will be challenged by the critical thinking about their 

practice. By the end of the course students will have learned both technical 

skills as well as being introduced to historical, theoretical, and artistic 

uses of the video medium as they have been developed and used by visual, 

conceptual, performance artists/ experimental mediamakers.  This class is 

opened to all majors. 



Course Methodology



Class meetings will be spent learning technical skills training and practice, 

viewing works by video artists and others, discussing reading materials, and 

critiquing assignments. Strong focus will be given on opening up the 

conversation about our daily surroundings in the ethical, social and aesthetic 

point of view. Three sessions will be devoted to visiting artists, presenting 

and discussing their works with you. Students are also encouraged to attend 

one or more screenings and/or exhibitions of video work taking place during 

the semester. Editing will be done in Adobe Premiere on the computers of yours 

or in the computer lab.
