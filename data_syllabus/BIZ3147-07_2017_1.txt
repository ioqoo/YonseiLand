This course is motivated by a simple question with a set of possible, complicated answers: “What allows certain firms to earn positive economic 
profits while others deliver negative returns?” To answer this question, we will consider three potential approaches: value-creation & capturing, firm as a system of interactions, trial-and-error & luck. This is not accounting or statistics which begin with core, universally accepted principles and then build to harder problems and applications. Instead, business strategy is complicated and messy throughout, and we will be learning a set of new tools and concepts to answer the question above. In general, we will begin with early academic work in the area, and proceed to more contemporary, practical treatments. This will help you understand how thinking in each area has evolved.

By and large this course is designed to help the students to achieve the 
learning objectives of Yonsei School of Business: creativity, integrity, and 
global perspectives. More specifically, students will be able to: (1) 
understand the importance of ethics and corporate social responsibility in 
business practices; (2) understand the fundamental knowledge and analytical 
skills in strategic management; (3) think creatively and innovatively; (3) 
gain effective communication skills in a professional business context.
