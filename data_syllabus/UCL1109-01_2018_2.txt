Nowadays, the average size of the human body is bigger than before whereas human physical strength is lower. One of the reasons for this phenomenon is that the rate of bodily activities are naturally decreasing because of the wide distribution and use of convenient machines. This situation makes human beings feel as if they do not need to move their bodies. As a result, the rate of human physical and psychological illnesses have increased.
On the other hand, the amount of people who regularly go to the gym and participate in sports or other physical activities for their health and beauty have increased because self-care has become one of the most important factors in modern society. However, many people still don’t know how to work out correctly, so their bodies’ speed of improvement is slow. Therefore, people feel frustrated with themselves and then they eventually give up working out or end up quickly losing enjoyment of physical activities. Thus, the purpose of this lecture is to help students enjoy physical activities and to motivate them to approach various types of activities naturally and easily. As a result, students will have healthy bodies with healthy mentalities through this lecture.
