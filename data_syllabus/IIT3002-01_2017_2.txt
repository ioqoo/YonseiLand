The purpose of this course is to teach the general concepts and principles 
behind operating systems. The topic we will cover through this class as 
follows:

* Kernel and process abstractions and programming  
* Scheduling and synchronization
* Memory management and  address translation
* Caching and virtual memory
* File systems, storage devices, files and reliability

In addition to these lectures, we will also have term projects, which use an 
operating system simulator/emulator built for an educational purpose. In these 
projects, we expect that you not only can learn Linux practices but also make 
great strides in studies on operating systems design and implementation. This 
is in C/C++, rather than Java or Python. We believe that these projects will 
provide a more realistic experience in operating systems to students.
In this class, all homeworks are treated in an individual assignment; whereas 
projects are considered as a group assignment. In typical, it is difficult to 
figure out the contributions that each member committed, the submission for 
these projects will be done through a git repository per group (e.g., 
bitbucket), and TA will check all push and pull transactions to grade a team. 
Note that, in this sense, Intermediate pushes will help TA see how students 
are progressing. The project teams may be two persons, some may be threes; the 
number of students per team will be decided based on information of the final 
registration, and will be announced in classes.
