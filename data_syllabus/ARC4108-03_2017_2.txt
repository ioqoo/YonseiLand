Architectural Design Studio 6 will challenge students to explore new 
territories of formal and spatial relationships as they relate to Context and 
Scale.  

The studio will focus on the design of a small-scale multi-unit housing 
complex 
that will develop and hone critical design abilities and expand awareness of 
context and scale. These multiplicitous conditions will provide potential to 
re-
define networks of private and public spatial interaction as contemporary 
solutions for housing and habitation.

Architectural Design Studio 6 will challenge students to explore new 
territories of formal and spatial relationships as they relate to Context and 
Scale.  
Context:  physical and social aspects, such as urban fabric, existing 
buildings, infrastructure, movement patterns, history, community, etc., will 
inform the design process toward sensitive and broad-reaching architectural 
solutions.
Scale: students will be asked to work simultaneously across multiple scales in 
critical awareness of how architectural interventions create relational 
narratives between city / community / building / human scales.

The studio will focus on the design of a small-scale multi-unit housing 
complex 
that will develop and hone critical design abilities and expand awareness of 
context and scale. These multiplicitous conditions will provide potential to 
re-
define networks of private and public spatial interaction as contemporary 
solutions for housing and habitation.
