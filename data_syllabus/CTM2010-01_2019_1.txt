Business Model Analysis: This analysis article must address the real-world issues of product/service innovation (either from your work or other familiar companies). Topics can be related to your major and must be approved by the instructor. You will work in groups of 3-4 for this assignment. Typical innovation topics will focus on either a company (or a particular product/service of a company) and a critical strategic issue it is currently facing. You might not be able to gather enough information to analyze every aspect of product/service innovation covered in our course, but you should be able to conduct the analysis appropriate to at least nine sessions (industry dynamics, formulating/implementing innovation strategy, and collaborative product/service design). Specific and well-reasoned recommendations that connect tightly with your innovation analysis must be given. An online media format (such as UCC) is recommended to accompany your final report.
