This course provides a foundational knowledge of modern Chinese history, and 
also poses the most fundamental questions about the meaning of China’s modern 
experience. With an emphasis on the intersection of intellectual and political 
history, where power and ideas converge, we rethink the grand narrative of China 
from the highpoint of the Qing Dynasty in 1800, to the lowpoint of Republican 
era warlordism and semi-colonialism in the 1930s, all the way through the 
extraordinary return of China to economic and political significance since the 
start of “reform and opening up” in the 1970s. 
The class will focus on a dozen seminal intellectual and political leaders who 
in many ways defined the course of modern Chinese history. We will study their 
changing diagnoses of China’s problem and their prescriptions for “saving” 
their country. In the last weeks of the class, we will look at how China is 
being transformed by the attainment of the constant goal of modern leaders—
wealth, power, and status, and, finally, consider the possibilities of what 
might come next.
