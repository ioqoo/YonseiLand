Why do some firms outperform other firms? The many possible answers to this important question are the focus of strategy. Strategy refers to 
the set of actions taken to achieve a particular goal; and in business settings, to how firms succeed by attracting customers while at the 
same time making more profit for investors. The perspective adopted in this course is that of firms (e.g. that of top managers) making decisions 
regarding: 
(a) what businesses firms should focus on; and (b) how to run those businesses. We will explore different analytical models that allow us to 
systematically identify external conditions that companies face in complex and competitive environments, and to propose sound and realistic 
solutions to these problems based upon a deep understanding of what firms have and can do, commonly called resources and capabilities.
