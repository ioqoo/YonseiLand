This course is about understanding why some firms outperform others especially in light of the global environment. We will examine how to formulate and implement effective organizational strategies that incorporate analytical, behavioral and creative aspects of business simultaneously. Recognizing that most real business problems are inherently multi-functional in nature, we strive to integrate learning from your prior studies of functional areas, while adding new approaches that explicitly deal with business-wide strategic and competitive issues. Our viewpoint will be that of the general manager who has responsibility for the long-term health of the entire organization.
