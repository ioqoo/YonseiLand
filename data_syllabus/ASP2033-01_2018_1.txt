As introduction to the course, we begin with a critical look at how North Korea becomes legible and visible. What seems like propaganda to us, what seems like the “real” North Korea, and why? 

As historical backdrop, necessary (but not sufficient) for understanding North Korea today, we will take a brief look at North Korea when it was part of the socialist world. Starting with North Korea’s founding years, we will consider how North Korean history can be understood apart from the story of Kim Il Sung and his family. 

We then examine the more recent past, at issues frequently raised in connection with North Korea in the post-socialist world: that is, the famine that killed so many in the mid-/late 1990s, the 1994 Agreed Framework that could have led to peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula, and the issue of ideological indoctrination and human rights. 

In the final part of the course, we will examine several critical and unique perspectives on how to understand and engage North Korea.
