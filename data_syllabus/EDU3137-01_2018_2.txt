Understanding education from a cultural perspective is a requisite in 
interpreting OECD’s claim that “education is for life, not for the 
classroom.”  If education is to teach people how to live, it is indispensable 
to understand how education affects and is affected by culture, which is the 
core of life. A comparative approach of the cultural analysis of education is 
increasingly becoming a common scientific tool to better understand how 
educational theories and practices vary according to the elements defining the 
culture of the educated, the educator, and the educational system. This class, 
Comparative Cultural Understanding of Education, allows students to engage in 
the dynamic and global nature of education and the rigorous ways in which 
scientific information and knowledge are produced and constructed based on 
individual differences, cultural circumstances, and local and global 
phenomena. In particular, it is aimed at:
1. providing theoretical exposure on the core concepts of education, culture, 
and comparison;
2. comparing and analyzing theoretically backed and scientifically proven 
aspects, cases, and issues of concern to culture and education; 
3. offering opportunities for students to express their emic and etic views 
whenever they find appropriate to position themselves as either the bearers or 
observers of culture or educational experience; and
4. encouraging the use of socio-culturally influenced subjective and objective 
lenses in comparatively reading, speaking, listening, and writing about the 
educational issues that will be uncovered in class.
