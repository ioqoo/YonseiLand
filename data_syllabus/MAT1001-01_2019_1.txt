MAT1001 offers a calculus curriculum which builds from high school calculus that may have involved a great deal of calculations and procedures. This course is an advanced version of college calculus that reviews the mathematical concepts behind the thinking and reasoning of calculus and solving application problems. As such, we will engage in proofs and complex problem solving in a way that prepares you for increasing mathematical literacy, along with creative thinking and problem solving skills. (MAT1001-01 will be taught in English.)
