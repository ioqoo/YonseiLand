집합연산의 기본 개념을 공부하고 무한집합의 크기를 다루는 기수(Cardinal number),
서수(Ordinal number)와 그들의 연산에 대해 배운다. 
이과목은 수학전반의 기초가 되며, 특히 수리논리학과 공리론적 집힙론을 이해하는 
배경이 된다.

Welcome to the wonderland of set theory. Set theory is a beautiful and magical 
subject stemmed from transparent and easy observations  leading us to a 
surprising and somewhat unbelievable  logical world on which contemporary 
mathematics is based. Its controversial and contrasting history attracts our 
attentions as well.  In this beginning course, I will focus on elementary part 
of set theory such as set operations, orderings, cardinal and ordinal 
arithmetics which, as primitive notions, are absolutely necessary  in learning 
almost every subject of mathematics. At the same time I will introduce more 
mysterious and advanced part of the subject, though whose  full clarifications 
can possibly be covered in senior or graduate level courses.     
No prerequisite is required. This is a Korean course.
