This course is the laboratory companion course to the lecture-based Organic 
Chemistry course, although it is a completely separate course in terms of 
grade and credit. It is meant to be an introduction to the major concepts of 
chemical investigation, organic chemistry, and laboratory techniques. One of 
the objectives of this course is to have students become familiar and 
comfortable in the laboratory itself. This includes having the enrolled 
students use numerous chemical reagents, a wide variety of chemical equipment, 
and proper laboratory procedures for their own safety as well as the safety of 
other students.
