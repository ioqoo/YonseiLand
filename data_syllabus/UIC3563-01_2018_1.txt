In the course, we will study Heidegger`s Being and Time (Sein and Zeit), which 
is widely regarded as one of the great philosophical masterpieces of the 
twentieth-century, and is one of the foundational texts of the so-
called "continental" tradition of philosophy. In Being and Time, Heidegger 
challenges what he regards as the underlying presuppositions of the Western 
tradition of philosophy, and suggests a new way of thinking about the way in 
which human beings exist in the world.
