Topics in Fiction

This course will focus on the art and craft of writing fiction. Students will 
create original works of fiction that will be reviewed in small and large 
discussion groups. Literary topics of form, character, dialogue, plot, and 
other contemporary strategies will be at the forefront of our weekly meetings. 
Additional course texts will include novels and short-story collections from 
around the world. 

Topics in Fiction will focus on special topics and genres determined by members of the class. Possible genres will range from fantasy to conventional realism and avant-garde literature. 

After the first few weeks of literary analysis, we`ll begin to workshop student 
fiction. Members of this class will submit and receive feedback on at least two 
stories. All classes will be highly interactive, and members will experiment 
with new writing styles and gain insight from a group of diverse and thoughtful 
readers.
