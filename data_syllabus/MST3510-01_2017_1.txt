Many relevant case studies from fundamental research and industrial applications of advanced materials to nanotechnology will be used to exemplify 
the concepts taught. Our final goal will be to utilize modern density-functional theory and advanced atomistic models to help interpret and understand the properties of real materials (e.g. electronic, magnetic and optical devices, sensors, catalysts and hard coatings). The materials presented in this course will focus primarily on the conceptual (chemical-physical) content while keeping the mathematical level basic, appropriate to the broad audience.
