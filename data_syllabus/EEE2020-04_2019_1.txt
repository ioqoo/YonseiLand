This class is about the basics of data structures and algorithms. 
What we will be covering is how to design algorithms, how to implement them, how to analyze their behavior, and how to use them to solve problems.
We will use Python for the implementation. You donâ€™t need to know all about it. 
The first two or three weeks will cover the Python programming from scratch. 
After that, we will study fundamental tools essential to be a ninja coder: Algorithm analysis, basic data structures (stacks, queues, deques, list), recursion, sorting, searching, trees, and graphs. 
You may learn how to use some tools (e.g., MarkDown, LaTex, and Jupyter notebook) as well. 

Note the plan below is tentative, and is subject to change.
