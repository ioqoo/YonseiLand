Cultures of Marxism and Modernity in East Asia
In many parts of East Asia, across the twentieth century, Marxist thought gained great popularity. The doctrines and ideas associated with Marxism have had formative influence not only on China, Vietnam and North Korea, but also on Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, where it played a key role in student, labor, and democratization movements. However, as Marxism was initially a product of European modernity, it underwent important transformations in its encounter with different socio-cultural, political, and economic contexts across Asia. What, then, were the reasons that made Marxism so popular and relevant in East Asia, and how did the doctrines and ideas associated with Marxism travel? What aspects were lost in their Asian transformations, and what aspects were gained? How did Marxism interact with the ideologies of Confucianism, nationalism, liberalism, and fascism in the Asian context? And in what ways did Marxism function as a modernizing discourse in East Asia and in what ways did it offer a critique of modernity?
 This course will consider these and other related questions through a careful reading of Marxist philosophy and political theory, alongside the intellectual and cultural history of Marxism in East Asia. Examining a variety of texts from history, theory, literature and film, we will pay special attention to the intersection of art/culture, ideology, and politics?formally and thematically?to advance an understanding of Marxist culture or aesthetics, as well as examine key themes that distinguish Marxist thought vis-?-vis its development across East Asian historical contexts, such as anti-imperialism, nationalism, post/colonialism, and anti-fascism.
