Technology and Design can and have been considered separate fields. Interaction between the two has occurred only when the production process required their collaboration. That is the past. Today the lines between technology and design are fading to where they are codependent on each other if not actually the same. Integrating Technology and Design covers the wide range of possibilities when technology and design are considered as equal parts of a greater whole. In this class we can regard a working technology and a finished design as incomplete without itâ€™s counterpart.

In this class, students are positioned to design a solution as well as implement the technology supporting the design. The final projects will be working prototypes that illustrate the integration, and necessary fusion of Technology and Design. Projects can use software or hardware based technologies as well as screen based 2D, 3D, or industrial designs in nature.

It is not necessary for the technology to be build from the ground up. The students will be introduced to resources for using open-source software and hardware as well as physical designs for their prototypes. 

Integrating Technology and Design presents an opportunity to benefit from the collaboration between technology and design, understand why this is already happening in the larger tech companies as well as startups, and produce a working prototype that takes advantage of this union.
