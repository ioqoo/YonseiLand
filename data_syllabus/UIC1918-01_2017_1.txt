This course counts towards UIC’s scientific literacy requirement. It is 
essentially an introduction to cognitive science with a special emphasis in 
the latter half on how cognitive science bears on social issues such as 
intelligence, sex and morality. The first part of the course focuses on models 
of the structure or architecture of the mind/brain. We will look at different 
“levels” of characterizing the mind/brain and different contributions made 
by different fields –including linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, 
psychology and philosophy– toward characterizing the structure and nature of 
cognition. In particular, we will examine two competing and central 
architectural proposals: the mind as a physical symbol system and as a neural 
network. In the second part of the course, we will examine how contemporary 
cognitive science contributes to our understanding of sexual psychology, 
heritability and intelligence, as well as moral beliefs and ethical reasoning. 
Successful completion of this course will leave the student with an 
understanding of how cognitive scientists marshal evidence and arguments, from 
a variety of disciplines, for their preferred explanations of the mind/brain. 
Students will also leave the course with an understanding of how competing 
theories pertain to important social issues in the cognitive sciences, and 
that these areas of research are very active and potentially ground-
breaking.
