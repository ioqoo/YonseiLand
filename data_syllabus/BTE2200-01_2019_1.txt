This course focuses on carbon-based chemistry, with an emphasis on 
understanding the structural nature of organic molecules and how that 
knowledge can help with the prediction of physical and chemical properties of 
compounds.  The material is organized into families of organic molecules and 
includes alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, alkadienes, alkynes, alcohols, alkyl 
halides, allylic systems, and arenes.  The basics of reaction mechanisms are 
introduced and include the free radical halogenation of alkanes, nucleophilic 
substitution, and elimination.
