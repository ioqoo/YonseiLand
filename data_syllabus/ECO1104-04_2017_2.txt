Economics is the study of how society makes decisions and manages its scarce 
resources, and is based on a few principles that can be applied in most 
situations. Microeconomics is concerned with the analysis of individual 
economic actors, industries and markets. In macroeconomics we look at the 
entire economy as a whole and study such topics as unemployment, inflation, 
GDP, and interest rates.

Macroeconomics is the study of how the economy as a whole grows and changes 
over time. This course develops the fundamental tools of economic analysis and 
then puts these tools to use in modeling how nations use scarce inputs to 
produce output. The student will learn how to measure economic performance. 
There are many elements and dimensions to the performance of the economy (GDP, 
inflation, unemployment, etc.). Here we learn not only what these measures 
are, but also get a perspective on the strengths, weaknesses, and uses of 
each. Emphasis will be placed on developing graphical and algebraic models 
which can be used to analyze these topics.
