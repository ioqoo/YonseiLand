How courageous are you? Are you willing to take a chance? Has the fear always 
blocked your path? Those questions seem ordinary, but we all need to examine 
our minds in order to find our hidden talent.  This course is about personal 
journey. Class will participate various exercises that are out of the ordinary: 
challenging tasks that are forbidden, creating something special from the 
ordinary, learning to welcome a failure, and, at the end, gaining the 
confidence, a quality we all possess but hidden. In my class there is no right 
or wrong answer. A journey that will lead to discover that talent expresses 
itself differently. 
 Each week we will examine the success of artists, entertainers, and other 
famous people, such as Steve Jobs, Beatles, and others. What made them who they 
are? According to Dr. Ken Robinson, a world-renowned educator and author of 
Find Your Element, it is of knowing ones Element.  Element is, “to describe 
the place where the things we love to do and the things we are good at come 
together.”
Nurturing our mind is not easy, but with constantly challenging our thought we 
can go beyond what is taught in the academic environment.

• Obtain a basic understanding how a creative mind can improve our self-
confidence.
