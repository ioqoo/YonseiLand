Course Description:
The basic and essential work for materials scientists is needless to say to pioneer revolutionary and innovative new materials to develop novel devices. Spintronics (spin+electronics) is regarded as one of emerging nano-technologies that is supposed to play an important role in electronics in  near future. In spintronics, the new paradigm of an additional degree of freedom, spin, of an electron is introduced which provide with advanced functions not only current electronic devices but newly proposed spin-utilizing devices. The spin that has been ignored in current electronics until now can provide digitalized signals in a simple way using states of spin-up and spin-down. Spin valves, non-volatile magnetic random access memory (MRAM) and spin transistors belong to spin devices, for example. In this lecture, we concentrate on studying of magnetics which is prerequisite to study spintronics. We also spend time reviewing the fundamentals of electromagnetism. The lecture covers; Fundamentals of electromagnetism (vector, scalar, electric field, magnetic field), Types of magnetic order. Atomic origins of magnetic moments. Exchange energy and ferromagnetism. Magnetic anisotropy. Domains, domain walls, and their origin. Magnetostriction. If time allows, introduced are applications of magnetic materials, especially for spintronic devices such as spin field effect transistor (spin FET), memory, logics, oscillators and ultra-sensitive sensors based on the spin injection, control and operation of an electron`s the other nature SPIN. Project related to spintronic devices.
