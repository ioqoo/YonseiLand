Digital media has had a major impact on the way we relate to ourselves, to each other, and to the wider world. This course will explore, among other things, the resulting effect on our personal and social psychology, politics, epistemology, and economics. Along the way, we will consider which parts of digital media show the most promise for providing a net benefit for human welfare, and which parts ought to be avoided/neutralized as much as possible. These issues will all be considered from both a personal and a policy perspective.
