Genre Studies 

This course will focus on the art and craft of writing Genre Fiction. Mystery, 
Fantasy, Romance, Science Fiction, Horror, Inspirational, and 
other genres will be explored during weekly readings. Students will create 
original works of genre fiction that will be reviewed in small and large 
discussion groups. Literary topics of form, character, dialogue, and other 
contemporary strategies will be at the forefront of our weekly meetings. 
Special emphasis will be given to the investigation and construction of 
dramatic plot.

Additional course texts will map genre lines and introduce hybrid storytelling 
from around the world. After the first few weeks of literary analysis, we`ll 
begin to workshop student fiction. Members of this class will submit and 
receive feedback on at least two stories. All classes will be highly 
interactive, and members will experiment with new writing styles and gain 
insight from a group of diverse and thoughtful readers.
