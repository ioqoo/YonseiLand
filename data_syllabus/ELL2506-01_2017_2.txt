In the years between the end of the Second World War and the election of Theresa May as Prime Minister, “the empire-state” as David Cannadine suggests, “was superseded by the much-diminished island-state”. This decline was a complex affair, since while the Empire was effectively wound up with the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, living standards in the United Kingdom continued to rise. One of the main reasons for this was that the UK had done a remarkably good job at selling itself to the world: the island-state had successfully replaced the British Empire with the wholesale global marketing of its major cultural attractions. From football to fashion, from music to the monarchy, British culture had “never had it so good”?at least on the world stage. By examining important examples of the representation of what it means to be “British”?and often, more particularly, what it means to be English?we can hope to understand this complex subject a little better. The first half of the course will deal with the years between the end of the Second World War and the emergence of “Swinging London” in the mid-1960s. The second half of the course will deal with the ascent of Thatcherism and the immediate post-Thatcher era, culminating in the death of Lady Diana Spencer and the ascent of Tony Blair.
