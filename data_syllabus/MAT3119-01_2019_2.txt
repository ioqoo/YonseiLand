This course studies a general introduction to enumerative 
combinatorics. Combinatorics is one of important branches of 
modern mathematics and we will browse systematic development of 
mathematical tools for enumeration. Topics like basic counting 
rules, permutations, partitions, graphs, and formal power series.
The ideas and techniques of bijective combinatorics give a lot of 
applications not only to pure mathematics but also to other 
sciences. Besides, they give us to expand our ability of logical 
ways of thinking and creativity.
