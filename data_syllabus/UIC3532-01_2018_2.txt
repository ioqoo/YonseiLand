Course Outline

1)This course is designed to provide students with an overview of business/marketing in the global context.   

2)We also discuss the best online/offline practices for brands/customer relationships /distribution channels/advertising in Korea and Overseas.

3)As part of our curriculum, student groups apply in-class materials to develop their own startups by following the guidance provided by Yonsei Enterprise Support Foundation.  Students will have a hand-on experience of doing business in real world markets. Upon successfully completing this course, the CBL certificate (Community-based Learning Certificate) will be issued by Yonsei University to students. The certificate will be very useful in pursuing job or academic careers. 

4)By going through all the steps with their group members like Silicon Valley-style startup folks, students would get to a deeper understanding of business and social responsibility. 

5)There will be several guest speakers (from industry) and possibly group sessions on Thursdays (instead of Tuesdays). Students are expected to stay in class until 6:50 pm on Thursdays if required.      
If you have any questions about scheduling, please contact me at jsuh123@yonsei.ac.kr.

6) This class is also designated as a Social Innovation Certificate (SIC) course by Yonsei University. The course contents and practices will be related to social innovation and social problem solving. The Institute of Higher Education Innovation (IHEI) may collect and accumulate student assignments and course contents for further purpose.
