This general education course is designed to provide students not majoring in a life science with knowledge about how biological principles are being applied to solve modern day problems. After an introduction to the properties of life, we will cover current topics that often appear in the media, such as genetically modified foods, metabolic engineering, stem cell technologies, synthetic biology, and personalized medicine. The overall goal is for students to understand some of the basic science behind these biotechnological applications and to become aware of the strengths and limitations of current technologies. In addition students will learn about the associated benefits and possible ethical concerns so that they may have informed opinions about the development of such technologies.
