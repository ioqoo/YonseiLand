OVERVIEW: 
This course will introduce you to some of the questions that philosophers ponder, and invite you to ponder them yourself. The course covers a range of philosophical areas to entice you into thinking philosophically no matter where your interests lie, and also so as to encourage you to discover interconnections between these areas. Weâ€™ll discuss core questions in philosophy of religion and metaphysics (which is the study of the nature of reality). 

There are two broad aims to the course. One is that you gain some fluency in philosophical thinking, writing, and reading techniques. The other is that you become familiar with some of the major philosophical positions that have been put forward on these issues and some of the arguments in support of each.
