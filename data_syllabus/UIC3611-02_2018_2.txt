This course examines early works of modern Korean literature (1900-1950) focusing on the longstanding rivalry between writers in Seoul and Pyongyang?the capital cities of two Koreas?and, more broadly, the Kyonggi region and P’yongan Province. We will challenge the presumed notion of Korean literature, which has been defined as “literary works written by Korean writers in the Korean script.” The rivalry between Pyongyang and Seoul poses a question of the writers’ identities, while early modern Korean literature complicates the problem of the definition of the Korean script. In other words, writers from the two regions often felt estranged from each other, and the early form of Korean written language differs from the present style of Korean writing. Thus, the first goal of this course is to grasp “which Korean” built the modern form of Korean literature and “which Korean script” was used. 
The second goal of this class is to improve students’ skills in reading early modern Korean accurately and at sufficient speed to become a more useful research tool. The assigned reading will give ample opportunities to attain that goal while providing a new perspective on modern Korean writing.
