Marxism and Modernity in East Asia
In many parts of East Asia, across the twentieth century, Marxist thought gained great popularity. The doctrines and ideas associated with Marxism have had formative influence not only on China, Vietnam and North Korea, but also on Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, where it played a key role in student, labor, and democratization movements. However, as Marxism was a product of European modernity, embodying the Enlightenment belief in reason and science, as much as the European understanding of revolution and birth of a new social order based on equity and social justice, not to mention other structures and categories specific to European societies, it underwent important transformations in its encounter with different socio-cultural, political, and economic conditions and imperatives for modernization in various imperial, colonial and postcolonial East Asian contexts.  What, then, were the reasons that made Marxism so popular and relevant in East Asia, and how did the doctrines and ideas associated with Marxism travel to East Asia? What aspects were lost in their Asian transformations, and what aspects were gained? How did Marxism interact with the ideologies of Confucianism, nationalism, liberalism, and fascism in the Asian context? And in what ways did Marxism function as a modernizing discourse in East Asia and in what ways did it offer a critique of modernity?
This course will consider these and other related questions through a careful reading of Marxist philosophy and theory, alongside the intellectual and cultural history of Marxist thought in East Asia. Examining a variety of texts from history, theory, literature and film, we will pay special attention to the cultural effects of these political influences to help us understand the broader impact of Marxism on the politics and culture of East Asia as well as the distinctions and gaps that remain between Western and East Asian variants of Leftist thought and culture today.
