The 10th through 13th centuries are often called "The Chinese Renaissance." 
This was a time of unprecedented economic growth, technological innovation, 
and ambitious domestic and foreign policy. At the same time, intense 
philosophical questioning led to the growth of Neo-Confucianism, the most 
influential form of Confucianism in East Asia today. While traditional 
historians have portrayed this period as a tragic low point in “Chinese” 
military power, more recently it has come to be seen as an exciting time of 
material prosperity and cultural transformation. 
In this course we will examine how these trends fit together, and how they 
affected the lives of both famous and ordinary people. Through the reading of 
both famous and lesser-known literary works, we will also explore how people 
living in this era described their own experiences. By the end of the course, 
students will be better able to understand multiple ways of talking about a 
society, as well as evaluating the evidence used to support alternative views.
