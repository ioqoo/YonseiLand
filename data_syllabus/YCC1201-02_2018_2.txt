Advanced College English I is an integrated, two-credit course designed to improve 
academic listening and speaking for students at the advanced level. 
Students will develop the oral and aural competencies that are essential to 
successfully communicate in an academic environment. In the classroom, learner 
involvement, interaction, and critical thinking are highly encouraged and 
promoted. To ensure the acquisition of the core language functions, students 
will utilize a variety of listening and speaking strategies necessary to 
participate in discussions, speeches, and presentations.

Students will gain confidence functioning in an academic English-speaking 
environment. They will be exposed to authentic listening materials such as 
news or lectures. By participating in group discussions and oral projects, 
students will develop their academic English oral and aural skills. They will 
learn to communicate clearly and effectively in a group setting. Through these 
practices, students will become both active speakers and strategic listeners.
