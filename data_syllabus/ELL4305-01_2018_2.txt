# Course Objectives
Syntax, roughly speaking, is the study of sentence structure, and its main 
goal is to discover and state the rules and conditions which generate all and 
only the grammatical sentences of a given language. In this course, we will 
look at a substantial fragment of English syntax, with the dual aim of (a) 
getting a sense of the range of possibilities in English, and (b) testing 
various types of hypotheses which have been developed to explain many 
important syntactic phenomena in this language.

# Quizzes (10%)
You will be given a quiz at the end of the review class for two or three main 
topics. There will be four regular quizzes in total, and the lowest score will 
be dropped. There will be no make-up quizzes unless arranged in advance for a good reason.

# Mid-term and Final Exam (40+40%)
No make-ups will be given, unless you have documented proof of a university accepted reason (your illness or a 
family emergency.
