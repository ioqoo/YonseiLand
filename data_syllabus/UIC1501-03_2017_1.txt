This is a forward-looking history seminar, using world history 
to explain how important components of the contemporary world came to 
be, and discuss what this historical trajectory suggests for future 
developments. For example, to understand institutions like the European Union 
or the United Nations, or issues like the Israel-Palestine conflict or the 
North Korean nuclear program, you have to understand the history. This course 
teaches you that history, and then asks you to think about what the past tells 
us about the future.
