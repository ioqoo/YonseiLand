MAT3109 is the first course in a two semester sequence for the junior/senior 
level undergraduate modern algebra. Modern algebra course covers all the 
topics such as groups, rings, modules, and fields in algebra commonly used by 
analysts, combinatorists, computer scientists, geometers, logicians, number 
theorists, or topologists.

MAT3109 (Modern Algebra covers topics such as groups, rings, fields and Galois theory, 
vector spaces and modules, as well as applications of these. Modern Algebra 
gives students a multi-perspective on the subject. This includes, 
understanding abstract theories, doing computations both algebraic and 
numerical, and finally seeing some applications of algebra in other branches 
of mathematics and in the real-world.  

The learning objective of the course MAT3109 (Modern Algebra 1) includes the following.
1. To classify algebraic structures in groups, rings, integral domains, modules, 
and fields, etc. 
2. To understand the elements of modern and abstract algebra with an emphasis on 
concepts, methods of proof, and the communication of mathematical ideas
3. To know and be able to use the basic definitions and the fundamental 
principles including the laws and theorems arising from the concepts covered 
in this course
4. To demonstrate ability to think critically by recognizing patterns and 
principles of Modern Algebra and relating them to problems in this or other 
mathematical disciplines
5. To give the student a solid grounding in modern algebra which is used in 
analysis, combinatorics, computer science, geometry, logics, number theory, 
topology, statistics, and many fronts
6. To provide the strong foundations for more in-depth explorations.
