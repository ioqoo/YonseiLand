Every choice is all about the trade-offs. Every time you make a choice, you incur an opportunity cost whether you realize it or not. 

Microeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior("and the choice") of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources("trade-offs") and how  they interact in specific markets.  This course aims for the students to understand how an economy is working under microeconomic scheme. 

The first half of the course will mostly treat topics in individual behavior- how each economic agent acts, how market is organized and works.

In the second half, we will proceed to firms behavior - how firms compete in different structures of the market.  Topics related to International trade and market failure will be introduced as well. 

Hope this course will be a good opportunity to better understand the economics!
