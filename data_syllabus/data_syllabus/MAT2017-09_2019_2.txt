We study Fourier analysis and basic partial differential equations of 
engineering. Fourier analysis has basic applications related to boundary 
initial value problems of mechanics, heat flow, and other fields. Many 
engineering problems can be modeled and solved by functions of a complex 
variable. We study the theory of complex analytic functions called complex 
analysis in order to solve such complicated problems in heat conduction, fluid 
flow, electrostatics, etc.
