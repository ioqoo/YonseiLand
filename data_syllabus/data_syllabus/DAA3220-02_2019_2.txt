##
Physical Chemistry I dealt with basic thermodynamics. Physical Chemistry II 

focuses on chemical change, which includes molecular in motion, the rate of 

chemical reaction and the kinetics of complex reactions. Also molecular 

reaction dynamics that has relation with molecular collisions is studied. 

Finally, surface tension and adsorption which are explained by surface 

phenomena are discussed.
