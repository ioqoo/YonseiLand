It would be an understatement to say that the digital revolution has had a profound impact on the way we learn languages, communicate, and gather information.  Virtual Reality (also called VR) is one of the hottest emerging technologies today. This course will focus on using VR technology to create interactive language learning contents for the Sejong Institute’s forthcoming textbook Yeohaeng hangugeo (Travel Korea). This immersive, cross-disciplinary, and project-driven course is open to all majors. In particular, students in the Humanities, Business, Communications, and Engineering are encouraged to enroll in this course. Students will learn how educational games are conceptualized and produced as well as the core skills needed to build VR products from immersive storytelling to design and programming (e.g., C++ and Unreal Engine). During the second semester, students who take this prerequisite course will work in smaller groups with a VR company to create one or two Oculus Quest VR contents for the textbook. To that end, students will engage with course readings on the fundamentals of Virtual Reality but also its applicability in various fields such as communications, education, design, marketing, tourism, and medical science. Students will also participate in labs where they will experiment with different applications using industry-standard software tools like Oculus Quest as well as become familiar with Adobe tools like Premiere, After Effects, and Photoshop. Students will be encouraged to experiment with 360 cameras (optional at LAB in Songdo).
