In this course, students develop the modern theories of the determination of the level and rate of growth of income, output, employment, and the price level. We will discuss the implications of each theory on fiscal and monetary policies. Students are expected to familiarize with the current macroeconomic data and its relevance. By the end of the course, students are expected to have a solid grounding in the basic theoretical approaches used in macroeconomics as well as an understanding of the economic data that is commonly analyzed. I strongly recommend students to take a look at the exam samples before enrolling the class. Once you enroll the class, you will be given exams with a similar format and difficulty. Final exams are cumulative and the average scores from both classes have been 60ish. Thus it would help align our mutual expectations and eliminate any asymmetric information.
