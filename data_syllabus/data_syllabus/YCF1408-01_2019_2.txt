This course is an integrated four-skill, three-credit course. This course is open for all Yonsei students but most of the content and materials will be related to using English in the humanities and social sciences. Students will be exposed to a wide range of written and spoken academic texts that are related to the subject matter and use these to help develop the oral and written competencies that are essential to successfully communicate in an academic environment. In the classroom, learner involvement, interaction, and critical thinking are highly encouraged and promoted. To ensure the acquisition of the core language functions, students will utilize a variety of listening, speaking, reading and writing strategies necessary to participate in discussions and presentations, and to write clear, concise, well-organized English compositions.
