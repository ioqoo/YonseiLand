This course is designed to help you to understand basic and essential concepts of language testing and also to give you the ability to design language test tasks for assessing students’ speaking and writing ability and to make test questions for assessing their reading and listening ability validly and reliably. 
  Often language tests have a harmful effect on teaching and learning, and fail to measure accurately whatever they are intended to measure. In the school context, therefore, it is very important that teachers should know how to properly assess students’ speaking and writing ability as well as how to make good English reading and listening comprehension test questions. 
  Throughout this course, you are expected to acquire the ability to make reading and listening comprehension test questions of different types through the practice of making test questions individually and cross­examining them together. Also, you can train yourself in order to assess students’ speaking and writing ability with students’ actual samples.
