"The Art of the Short Story" will look at key examples of the Anglo-American short story, from the beginning of the twentieth century until the present time. Each week, we will read an essay on some aspect of the short story as a literary and social form, read a short story, and try to discuss the short story in the light of that essay. The aim of the course will be to introduce you to the short story as one of the most significant and richest of our literary forms, a form that allows for a compressed exploration of some of the central aspects of human nature, including love, betrayal, regret, temptation, disappointment, fear and death. Some of the authors we will look at will include James Joyce, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Mary McCarthy, Mavis Gallant, Raymond Carver, James Lasdun, and Nathan Englander.
