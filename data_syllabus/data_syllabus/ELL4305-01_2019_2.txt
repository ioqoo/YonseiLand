Syntax, roughly speaking, is the study of sentence structure, and its main 
goal is to discover and state the rules and conditions which generate all and 
only the grammatical sentences of a given language. In this course, we will 
look at a substantial fragment of English syntax, with the dual aim of (a) 
getting a sense of the range of possibilities in English, and (b) testing 
various types of hypotheses which have been developed to explain many 
important syntactic phenomena in this language.
