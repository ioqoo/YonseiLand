Creating Creative Contents to Teach Korean Language and Culture through Webtoons: Over the past decade or so, there has been an explosion of interest in webtoons, a portmanteau of “web” and “cartoons,” which has given rise to all kinds of genres and topics, not only in number but breadth of its content. In 2003, the Korean web portal Daum created the first webtoon service followed by its rival Naver the following year. By 2014, Daum and Naver had published a combined 954 webtoons with a daily readership of approximately 10 million people. This course seeks to advance a new paradigm for teaching Korean language and culture through webtoons. Eschewing the traditional classroom setting and textbooks, this immersive, interdisciplinary, and project-driven course will focus on using online content creatively that will appeal to a new generation of students enabled by the digital revolution. Inspired by Lev Vygotsky’s studies (1978) which show that language learning should be in an “interactive environment,” this course will use webtoons as the primary platform to create new content for Korean language learning. Its distinction will be that every student will want to read the content (e.g., webtoons) which will in turn increase motivation, reduce stress levels, and most importantly elicit enjoyment and participation. The goal of this course is to create a new way to teach Korean language and culture in a creative way in the rapidly maturing field of Korean Studies but also critically engage with webtoons that have yet to tap into the global education market.

Over the past decade or so, there has been an explosion of interest in webtoons, a portmanteau of “web” and “cartoons,” which has given rise to all kinds of genres and topics, not only in number but breadth of its content. In 2003, the Korean web portal Daum created the first webtoon service followed by its rival Naver the following year. Enabled by the digital revolution and the constant innovation of smart mobile devices, webtoon artists have been pushing and transgressing the boundaries of comics beyond the rigid grids and panels to a scrollable vertical layout that is both screen-based and accessible to anyone.
