This is a course in public speaking for advanced majors in English.  Students 
will give speeches in a number of rhetorical modes, and group projects will 
also be undertaken, including a group debate.  The course will involve a high 
degree of participation and practice both in preparation for the various 
speaking assignments and in order to develop better facility in delivery.  All 
speeches will be evaluated according to the two criteria of content and 
delivery. Some of your speeches in this class will also be filmed so that we can assess 
delivery strengths and weaknesses.  We will allow time in class to review the 
film in order to improve performances.
The speeches made in this course will be given a time limit, and a significant 
part of your grade for each speech will be contingent on your management of 
time.  It is recommended that you bring a timepiece to the podium for your 
speech (though being distracted by it or distracting your audience with it 
will reflect negatively on your participation grade).  Use your timepiece as 
an aid to stay within the allotted frame of time.  Speeches that are short of 
the required time or overtime will be docked by one point in the overall 
averages of the instructor and in peer evaluations.  Speeches will be halted 
if they extend past 30 seconds of overtime.  Evaluators are required to give a 
one on the evaluation criteria that are not carried out because of overtime 
speeches, for example, conclusions.  Consequently, it is absolutely essential 
that students practice their speeches sufficiently in order to meet the time 
requirements of the speeches.
