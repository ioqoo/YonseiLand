This class provides fundamental understanding of energy conversion by use of 
power electronic devices. Students are expected to perform analysis and 
synthesis of power electronic systems after this course. Expected ourcome 
includes:
1. Demonstrate the ability to analyze switching power converters in steady 
state using circuit averaging and determine DC voltages and currents
2. Be able to sketch current and voltage waveforms in a converter in steady 
state
3. Demonstrate the ability to size passive filtering components in a 
converters such as inductors and capacitors to obtain a desired ripple 
performance
4. Demonstrate the ability to derive small-signal linearized models for 
switching converters
5. Demonstrate an understanding of the effects of negative feedback on 
converter operation
6. Demonstrate the ability to simulate switching converter using both 
switching models and averaged models via PSCPICE
