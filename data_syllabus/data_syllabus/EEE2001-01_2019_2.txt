Biometric recognition, or simply biometrics, refers to the automatic 
recognition of individual based on their physiological and/or behavioral 
characteristics. Art, is the product or the process of deliberately arranging 
items in a way that influences and affects one or more of the senses, 
emotions, and intellect. 

This seminar puts together two seemingly unrelated topics aiming to 
familiarize students with current and future technologies in biometrics and 
its possible relation to art. This will lead students have an open mind on 
subjects in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and prepare 
them for good creativity.

In this course, the students will be required to participate in class 
lectures, visit museums apart from going through various existing biometric 
technologies. The class will be conducted in English.
