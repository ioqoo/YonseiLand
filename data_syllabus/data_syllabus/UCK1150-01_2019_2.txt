This course is designed around a very pressing world issue. 

A confluence exists between several concurrent phenomena in the developed world and which will soon face the developing world. These are; 
Women in the workplace; 
Retirement and pension systems; 
And falling fertility. 
The course will provide much opportunity for students to practice speaking with both partners and in wider class-based discussion. 

All materials will be provided by the professor.  

After midterms, students will begin writing their essays. While these are reviewed, students will be able to experience the Cambridge/Oxford tutorial system. (These resemble seminars where students are encouraged to lead and discuss the readings and materials being completed in class.) At the same time you will be able to challenge my critique of your essay. 

The essays you write are allowed to be rewritten AFTER the tutorial has been attended. This allows you the opportunity to find out exactly what drawbacks exist. 
The course will provide strategies for avoiding plagiarism. But it will also allow students to make mistakes and to fix them. 

Time considerations are significant but may allow a focus on other subjects including the Congo, where Africa`s `world war` took place from 1998-2003 killing over 5 million people and yet attracted very little attention. It would be very interesting to know why such an event was over-looked.
