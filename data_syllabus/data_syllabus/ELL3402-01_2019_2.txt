This course focuses on the component parts of English, including the sound system, the internal structure of words, the structure of phrases and sentences, and meaning, and examines how these components are acquired and used by English speakers. While an emphasis will be given to the structure of English, data from Korean will also be looked at for cross-linguistic comparisons. The overall goals are (a) to become familiar with the key concepts and terminology needed to describe and analyze language; (b) to gain a basic understanding of the way language works; (c) to appreciate how languages differ (and how they’re the same); and (d) to help in your reading of the first language acquisition literature.
