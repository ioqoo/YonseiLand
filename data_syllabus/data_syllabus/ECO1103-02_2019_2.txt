Principles of Microeconomics is an introductory course in microeconomics.

Microeconomics considers each individual as economic agents such as consumers and firms as they interact in the market to seek their best interests: it deals
with the process and the outcome of each agent`s behavior in the market.

This course covers consumer theory, firm theory, theory of industrial organization, theory of markets for factors of production, theory of inequality of income/wealth, and so
forth.

In this course we will study not only economic theory in abstract form but also how the workings (or failings) of real economy can be explained by economics.

Alongside diagrams and equations, stories will be used in understanding economics and the economy.
