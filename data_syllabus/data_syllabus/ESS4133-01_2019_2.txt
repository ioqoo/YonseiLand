This course aims to provide upper-level undergraduate students an holistic overview of physical processes that develop alluvial, eolian, lake, delta, shoreline, and shallow-marine, tidal depositional systems. The focus of this class ranges from applications of the basic principles i.e., sediment transport and depositional mechanics to stratigraphy and basin interpretation in various depositional environments.

River-, wave-, tide-, and gravity-driven processes are examined in modern depositional systems and considered in relation to sediment-flux, base-level, and autogenic changes. Application to the development of dynamic facies models and alluvial-shoreline-shelf-deepwater transitions in stratigraphic data.
