Memory is a fraught enterprise. For how a past is known and remembered is complicated by murky beginnings, inconclusive endings, multiple parties, and varied interests. Yet, more than ever before, with increasing intensity, visibility, and urgency, we are witnessing renewed calls to remember the past--so as to correct history, seek redress, and find justice. Now is an opportune moment, therefore, to reflect on why issues have come to be formulated in terms of remembering and forgetting and to consider why and how we remember--for what purpose, for whom, and from which position.

This is a course on memory and memorialization, that is, a course on why and how we remember and commemorate the past. We will question: How can we remember beyond re-authenticating what has already come down to us? How can we attempt to fill in the gaps of given knowledges without re-establishing yet another regime of totality? Why do we engage in commemoration and memorialization? What might be the significance of such ritual acts? How can we go beyond remembering our own to remembering our own and others? And, finally, how can we begin to imagine and enact a more just and ethical memory?

We will look into various forms and sites of memory and memorialization--from memoirs and testimony to short stories, novels, and films to memorials and museums--across time and space. Since knowing the past cannot be divorced from the contexts within which such recall occurs, we will also situate the study of memory alongside history. Some of the issues with which we will be concerned include the impact of trauma on memories, the relationship between individual/private and collective/public, the conflict between historical documentation and artistic representation, the dialectics of remembering and forgetting, the consumption of memory, and the struggle for a just future.
