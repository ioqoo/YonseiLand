This class is for beginners in Russian. The goal is to learn the alphabets, 
basic reading and writing, and basic grammar. After one semester of Russian 
students can hope to be able to introduce himself/herself, lead a conversation 
on a very basic level, purchase things, and generally be able to function as 
tourists for a short while if they are in Russia.
