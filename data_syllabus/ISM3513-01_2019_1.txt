This course examines the historical link between globalization and its 
impact on world development. While there are many different definitions 
for globalization, we will primarily focus on the unprecedented 
movement of capital, people, and information that followed the 
industrial revolution and the introduction of key technologies that 
interconnected the globe. We will also focus on issues such as 
the emergence of the world market for commodities, 
global consumption patterns and migration.

The first section of the course highlights various aspects of 
globalization from a historical perspective that will enable 
students to better understand the forces that shape the modern world. 
The second section then considers the fate of world development 
after World War II and focuses on three case studies of Africa, 
Latin America and East Asia. Students who take the course will gain 
a critical foundation for examining the history of development as well as 
broader insignts into the forces of globalization that shape our world 
today.
