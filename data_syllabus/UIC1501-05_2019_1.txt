This course considers the historical context that spurred the definition of the neologism “genocide” as well as the drafting and passage of the UN “Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide” (1948).  The course then examines examples of “genocide” in a world historical context and attempts to identify the broad political and sociological conditions that help to explain where, when, and why genocide might occur.  This survey will include historical examples ranging from the ancient period down to the present.
