World History: Group I, "Empires in East Asia" is an introductory overview of East Asian history from 600 to the present. In this course, we seek to understand the history of East Asia in a wider regional context. This subject matter is vast, comprising somewhere between a quarter and a third of humanity over the past 1500 years. As such, we will not attempt comprehensive coverage, but cross this vast stream of history by a number of stepping stones, loosely grouped under the heading of three separate empires: the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the Qing Empire (1644-1910) and the Japanese Empire (1895-1945).
