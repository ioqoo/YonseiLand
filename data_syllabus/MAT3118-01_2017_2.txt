##
In this course, we will discuss about the solutions of elementary problems 
involving partial differential equations such as the heat and wave equation 
and the equation of potential theory.
We will review occasionally, if necessary,  basic calculus and elementary 
differential equations.
We will present solution techniques and mathematical results with physical 
interpretations and proof of theorems after explanations.
