What is good writing? What does it look like in the real world? 
This course is for those students who want to experience and learn to write for an authentic audience, 
writing first person narratives that move people’s minds and hearts. 
We begin by learning from literacy narratives, how they work and how writing our own can expose our own assumptions and tendencies. 
Then, we will learn what gets published as good writing through the “Modern Love” column in the New York Times. 
We will learn how to read like a writer and apply that learning to our own writing. 
By the end of the course you will have written, through multiple drafts, two first person essays: 
a literacy narrative and an essay for “Modern Love,” following the New York Times guidelines. 
This is a writing intensive course where you learn writing by doing writing,so come prepared to write.
