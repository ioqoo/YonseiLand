This class offers engineering tools to the water resources-related problems using fluid mechanics. First, theoretical aspects of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics are covered, and hydraulics of closed conduits and open-channel hydraulics are handled. Finally, flow measurements, hydraulic similitude, and hydraulic model experiments are dealt.

Hydraulics provides engineering tools through mechanistic approach in water-
related problems in civil engineering. In the first part of the lecture, 
theories on hydrostatics and hydrodynamics are introduced. The second part 
adresses the closed conduit hydraulics and open-channel hydraulics, which are 
fundamental theories in applied hydraulics. Then, theories on hydraulic 
measurement and hydraulic similarity, related with hydraulic experiments, are 
introduced.
