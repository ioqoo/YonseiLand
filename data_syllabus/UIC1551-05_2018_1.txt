The subtitle for this course is Women and Art in Premodern Korea. This course examines premodern Korean art history from the perspective of women and art. We will study how gender roles and identities were socially constructed and how concepts relating to gender have been continuously reconstituted throughout the Joseon dynasty. Students will learn about the political, social, and cultural changes based on the Confucian social values and how it affected the representation of womenâ€™s identities. Throughout the course we will see various genres of paintings and discuss the didactic role of art in propagating the Confucian ideologies to Joseon women. Each lecture will present images of the artifacts and students must be prepared to use the required readings to discuss the objects within their philosophical, social, and cultural context. In this class, students will have a heavy reading requirement, several writing assignments, and presentations. In-class lectures will be followed by several museum visits guided by the instructor where students will practice analyzing the original artworks. By the end of the course, students will be able to convey their thoughts about art using various analytical tools and learn to express their ideas effectively both verbally and in writings.
