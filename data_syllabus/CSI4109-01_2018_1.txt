This course is designed for computer science undergraduate students to acquire basic concepts and knowledge about information security. The topics covered in this course are thus quite broad, such as cryptography, authentication, access control, security protocols, firewalls, intrusion detection, system security, malware, memory safety, software security, hardware security, web security, AI security, and usable security. We try to more focus on applied cryptography and software security from the view of those approaches, mechanisms, and tools used to make computer systems and networks more secure.
