In addition, while it is assumed that students have the ability to write paragraphs and essays this class will review argument and analysis based on evidence and some time will be given to review these skills.

In essence, Honours students will have longer essays and a more active debate session. In addition, Honours students will be utilizing `Jane`s World Insurgency and Terrorism` as well as `Jane`s Country Risk Assesment` which are only available on Yonsei campus through this class. (Accessed by the professor from Cambridge University.)

This course is designed to look at various world issues. 

As an Honours class, the aim is to look at perhaps three topics of interest for the first part of the term before requiring students to split up into three groups after choosing one of those to focus upon.
This has included; the Ukraine, ISIS, the Iranian nuclear talks, the insurgency in Pakistan and Afghanistan, India. 

Since Yonsei students have access to first rate analysis, subjects of higher significance such as the Paris attacks may be looked at instead.

A region which may also be looked at is the Congo, where Africa`s `world war` took place and over 5 million people died but the world`s media paid very little attention. It would be very interesting to know why such an event was over-looked.
