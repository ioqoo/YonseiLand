In this course we will explore the development of the modern scientific 
worldview through the major intellectual revolutions that have shaped it. We 
will begin with the Copernican Revolution in astronomy, along with the broader 
set of intellectual upheavals of which it was part, the so-called “Scientific 
Revolution”. We will then explore another startling revolution, the 
Darwinian, and the provocative movement that grew up around this. 
Amongst other things, we will explore the impact of Darwin’s ideas in 
Victorian England and why these led to the confrontation between 
science and religion that, in some quarters, persists to this day.  Finally, we will view Einstein’s revolutionary
impact on physicists’ conceptions of space and time. 

The overall aims of this historical exploration are to broaden your 
understanding of science.
