This course originated more than 5 years ago as Law and  Society: how law affects society and vice versa.  Now the course has developed more towards polemics dealing with conflicts within South Korea. 
The students will learn legal concepts through current events in Korea at the front lines of a changing society, politics and regional security.
Political consciousness of Korea will be raised through analysis of Mmajor events in Korea such as the Cheonan incident, mad cow propaganda, Taean oil spill, politization of sinking of Sewol, militant labor unions, etc.
In the first half of the course, the student is trained to read and interpret 
codified law as well as common law, and apply them to factual situations.  
The second half of the course will be oriented towards seminars by individual 
presentations and class participation on determining justice behind various 
legislations and policies.

We are going to start with how law affects us in our immediate vicinity as our 
speech, homes, work, gender, life and death, and eventually increase our 
radius to include business, trade, refugees, pirates, terror, and nuclear 
proliferation.
By the end of the course, the student will have enhanced his/her insight into 
workings of law and policy from home to the global arena.
