Course Description:
The acronym “BRIC” stands for the “Big Four” countries of Brazil, Russia, 
India, and China, which are the newly emerging economic powers in the age of 
globalization. In 2009, the BRIC countries officially created an international 
organization that was named “BRIC.” In 2010, South Africa became a member 
nation of this organization, and the group was renamed “BRICS.” For better 
understanding of the “BRICS” countries as leading emerging markets and 
powers, this course is designed to investigate the history, politics, and 
culture of each member nation.
Course Objectives:
This course will enable students to:
1) Understand BRICS as the leading economic powers in the age of 
globalization.

issues of BRICS in newspapers, films, and other media.
