The course will examine where South Korea stands in terms of trade networks (TPP,  TTIP, RCEP, etc.) where power is concentrated.  Also the course will examine the development from bilateral free trade agreements between two countries to regional free trade areas, and finally the trade networks mainly led by the U.S. and China.
The course covers exchange of goods and services across the borders, 
preferably with less barriers and restrictions, yet under 
the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO).  The class will discover 
how with freer trade, things become more affordable and at the same time the 
nations involved suffer the side effects of income disparity.
The first part of this course covers bilateral free trade agreements entered 
into or in process of entering into by Korea leading to regional trade 
agreements that will define the future power structure of the world.
The second part of the course will explore the actual players of the free trade 
agreements which include transnational corporations and trade of nontangible 
assets such as securities leading onto globalization.
