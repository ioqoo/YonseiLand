Security is the single most important concept in International Relations, but 
the way we think about it has changed greatly over time. This course will look 
at the different facets of security as the concept (and the world) has 
evolved. We will begin with traditional military security, and what might be 
called strategic studies, and follow the evolution of the idea to include 
newer and increasingly important concepts such as human and environmental 
security. By the end of the course, students will have a well-rounded 
understanding of the concept of security, and will be able to use it as a tool 
to investigate all aspects of international relations.
