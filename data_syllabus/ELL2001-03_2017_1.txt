Disclaimer
This syllabus IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE during the course at my discretion based on 
the specific needs of the class and should not be relied upon as the sole 
source of all assignment scheduling for the course. If youâ€™ve missed a class 
and are uncertain about what will be due next time, email another 
student to be certain what assignments will be due. Students who miss the 
first two weeks are thoroughly discouraged from trying to add the course. You 
will have missed too much material by then and I will not consent to add you.
