Twentieth-Century African-American Literature

This course focuses on twentieth-century African-African American literature. Beginning with W.E.B. Du Bois’s The Soul of Black Folk, we will visit the Harlem 
Renaissance, read expatriate figures like Claude McKay, Richard Wright, and James Baldwin, consider poetry by Gwendolyn Brooks, Maya Angelou, and Claudia Rankine, 
and look at novels by Zora Neale Hurston and Toni Morrison. Throughout the course, we will be reading with an eye towards Du Bois’s notion of African American 
“double-consciousness,” “this sense of always looking at one’s self through they eyes of others,” investigating how these writers illuminated and contested the condition 
of whiteness in America, particularly the recourse to ignorance and innocence.
