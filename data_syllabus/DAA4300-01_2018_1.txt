In this class, the fundamentals of fluid mechanics would be discussed. First, 
fluid statics will be discussed, then fluid kinematics will be covered. Based 
on the vector and tensor calculus, the principles of fluid motion would be 
covered. In addition, surface energy related fluid motion will be discussed in 
the class. The objective of this course is to learn the basic knowledge of the 
transport phenomena and to be skilled yourself at modeling a physical 
phenomenon.
