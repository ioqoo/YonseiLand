The goal of this course is to explore the relation between Korean and Japanese 
modern literature during the colonial period. To that end, we are 
going to read and analyze some modern writer`s works from Korea and Japan. The 
questions as to how much Korean literature has been `influenced` by Japan, how 
much Korean literature has `imitated` Japanese literature, and/or how much 
Korean and Japanese literature are the same or different, are not critical 
matters in this class. Instead, we will focus on the questions of how colonial 
cultural circumstances influenced the formation of Korean modern literature, 
and what the result was. Thus, we will attempt to answer these questions by 
reading some representative writer`s works from the colonial period.
