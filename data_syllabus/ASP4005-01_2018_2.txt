This seminar is designed for UIC seniors and juniors who wish to work on their own research project within a structured setting. Ideally, the student would have taken one or more Asian Studies courses prior to taking this seminar. After reading a common set of readings in the first half of the course, the student will explore in depth a specific problem or topic pertinent to understanding modern or contemporary life in Korea / East Asia. 

In the first part of the course we will read texts that critically examine some of the foundational ideas and practices that inform gender identity and expression, love and affect, capitalism, work, and life choices ? with special focus on youth. In the second part of the course our engagement with those theoretical texts should provide impetus and inspiration for examination of specific problems and topics chosen by the student.
