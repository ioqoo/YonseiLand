The course will emphasize the interaction between the human body environment 
and synthetic materials. Materials for medical implants and new biotechnolgy 
will be covered. Biomaterials directly impact many disciplines within the 
field of biomedical engineering. Tissue engineering, biosensing, imaging, and 
drug delivery interact directly with biomaterials. Development of new 
technologies in these varies disciplines may largely depend upon overcoming 
present material limits and improving material/biological environment 
interactions.
