This course introduces students to the cinematic tradition of modern China through a historical overview of filmmakers and filmic aesthetics, from the early 1930s through the first decade in the 21st century. As an artistic innovation, an intellectual current, and a political platform, Chinese cinema has always functioned as a site where nationalist, anti-imperial, and global identities and feelings are formed, negotiated, and remade. Cinematic traditions that we will cover include the early golden period in 1930s Shanghai, socialist filmmaking, Maoist Red films, female directors, postsocialist filmmaking (also known as the Fifth Generation), and the Sixth Generation (what some have called the Urban Generation). The middle and later parts of the course will also introduce Hong Kong and Taiwan cinemas, which offer competing “national” paradigms or paradigms that challenge the framework and conception of the “national cinema” model altogether. The last part of the course will expose students to newer trends in Chinese film studies, which include independent and underground films by Zhang Yuan, the Urban Generation represented by Jia Zhangke, and Sinophone cinema. Key issues that we will engage throughout the course include some of the followings: spectatorship, cinematic language, modernism, left-wing criticism, ideology, national mythology, primitivism, urbanism, women and the gaze, gender, class struggle, and linguistic politics and diversity. Students will gain some familiarity with films that belong to the classics of Chinese cinema; at the same time, we will learn new methods of deconstructing and unpacking the linkage between “cinema” and “the nation” in the continual process of China’s visual self-making.
