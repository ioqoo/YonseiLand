This seminar will explore some of the most important consequences of colonialism -- both prior to and after independence -- 
in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere in the world through a reading of literary narratives and theoretical texts. Some of the issues with 
which we will be concerned include the interactions between the culture and language of the colonial power and the colonized people, 
power relations, national consciousness, hybridity, and intertextuality.
