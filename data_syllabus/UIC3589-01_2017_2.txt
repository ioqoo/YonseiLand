Actual title and focus: "Hallyu and the Marketing of Korean Culture"

This is a course that will theorize the ideas of culture and subcultures, and engages with/uses Marketing as the concrete approach to the marketization of culture.

Note: This course is not one in "Culture Marketing" nor is it a celebration of Hallyu. 
Although K-pop is a topic we will cover in some detail, this is not a "K-pop course."
