Nanotechnology utilises the materials or devices in the scale of a few 
nanometers to a few tenth nanometers. Due to continuous device scaling in 
micro-electronics, understandingn and knowledge on materials` properties in 
nanoscale would be essential in near future. 
This course offers unifying framework for the basic idea to understand 
nanomaterials and nanoelectronic devices based on the understanding of the 
operation principles of classic electronic devices.
