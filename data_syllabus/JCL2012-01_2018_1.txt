Human rights is an emerging social science topic in neo-internationalism. But: What are ‘human rights?’ How do ‘western’ and ‘non-western’ definitions differ? How have states promoted rights, domestically and internationally? Is the ‘western model’ of human rights declining? We consider these and related topics. Our approach is interdisciplinary, drawing on philosophy, politics, law, culture, and international relations, and, throughout the class, we study historical and contemporary cases. Students will leave the course with an analytical ‘toolkit’ for evaluating any contemporary human rights issue. We compliment the lectures with class discussions and activities to stimulate learning and improve speaking and research skills.

GOALS - WE CONSIDER HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGH FIVE MODULES: 

1) THE HISTORICAL-PHILOSOPHICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ‘WESTERN’ MODEL OF HUMAN RIGHTS
2) NON-WESTERN VIEWS, INCLUDING FROM ISLAM, CHINA, KOREA, AND JAPA
3) DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MECHANISMS TO PROTECT AND PROLIFERATE HUMAN RIGHTS
4) THE FUTURE OF THE POST-WAR HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME
5) STUDENTS’ HUMAN RIGHTS PROJECT REPORTS AND PRESENTATIONS

I MAY CHANGE THE TOPICS AND TEXT BEFORE THE FIRST CLASS DAY. A FINAL SYLLABUS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED THEN.
