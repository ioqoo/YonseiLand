This course proposes a double focus in relation to popular culture and media: t
theoretical study of cinema as a media form and interpretive engagement with f
film texts. There will be two types of assignment each week: theoretical or i
interpretive essays by theorists and critics; and films to be watched i
individually before class. The aim of the course is to synthesize these two t
tracks of understanding of cinema as a significant site of popular culture and a
an enduring form of media.
