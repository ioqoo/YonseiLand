This course aims at improving students` ability of critical reasoning. We will try to achieve this by systematically studying arguments, which can be defined as a group of statements consisting of one conclusion and one or more premises. When the conclusion of an argument “follows from” its premises, the argument is a good one, and under the supposition that the premises are true, it provides us with good reason to accept (or believe) the conclusion. We will learn how to discern different types of arguments, and how to evaluate them.  

Needless to say, arguments play indispensable roles in all areas of science, in political debates and in everyday life. We use them not only to persuade other people, but also to convince ourselves. So every person with normal intellect (without taking any course in critical reasoning) already has some level of skill of employing and evaluating arguments. (In fact, this is what makes the course seem deceptively easy.) But it is also very often true that even intelligent and educated people make basic logical mistakes. So it is worthwhile studying reasoning and arguments in isolation and abstraction. In this way, students will not only become less vulnerable to logical errors, but also have deeper understanding of the nature of the methods we use to acquire knowledge.

The field of study we cover in the course belongs to logic, which may be defined as the systematic study of arguments. Logic, in turn, properly belongs to philosophy. So our course will be philosophical in nature. We will very often ask why certain arguments are good, rather than taking certain rules of arguments for granted.
