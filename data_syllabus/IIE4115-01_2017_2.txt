This class is for undergraduate students from a range of backgrounds studying in industrial engineering, computer science, etc. Human Computer Interaction is the study of how users interact with computing technology. HCI has become one of the most important areas of study and endeavor in Industrial Engineering, Information Science, Library Science and Technology Management.  There is a growing awareness among developers and users that technology often does not live up to its expectations.  Consumers often find that it is frustrating, confusing and difficult to work with. The discipline of HCI, through its methods, techniques, and practices attempts to understand the reason for this failure and to find user-centered solutions. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to HCI/Usability presenting a corpus of knowledge, and a practical set of well known, tested and necessary skills.  We will consider the impact of technology on society and culture.  Students will also learn how to gauge the usability of digital environments, tools and interfaces.  The student will be exposed to the most recent research behind the development process.  Students will learn how to conduct usability evaluation and user-centered design through term-project.
