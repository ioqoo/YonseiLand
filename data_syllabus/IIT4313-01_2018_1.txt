This course provides a mathematical introduction of comutation model. We will explore what kind of problems could be solved with the given model.
Students will be able to classify computational problems, in terms of their computational complexity (Is the problem regular? Not regular? Decidable? Recognizable? Neither? Solvable in P? NP-complete? PSPACE-complete?, etc.) They will also gain a deeper appreciation for some of the fundamental issues in computing that are independent of trends of technolog.
