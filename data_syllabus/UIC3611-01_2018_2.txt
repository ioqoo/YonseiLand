This course will explore the beginnings and developments of twentieth century 
Korean prose fiction through four representative examples of the novel. Modern 
Korean fiction, mirroring developments in society at large, took shape under 
various influences from its Western counterparts, albeit often mediated by 
Japan. This has led some to label modern Korean literature a “transplant.” 
Others, in rebuttal, have argued its indigenous roots. Both of these positions 
represent oversimplifications. The reality of modern Korea and its literature 
is hybridity: exchanges and negotiations between a strong tradition and a 
dynamic present. The novels examined in this course span—and in some ways 
chronicle—one of the most turbulent periods in Korean history. These works 
provide glimpses of Korea from the cataclysm of the Sino-Japanese War to the 
oppression of the Japanese Colonial Period, but they also testify to the 
endurance of everyday life, of personal, quotidian concerns that predate and 
will outlast present circumstances. It is precisely this sort of hybridity, 
these exchanges between Korea and the outside world, literature and history, 
social and personal concerns, that this course will interrogate using the 
modern Korean novel as medium.
