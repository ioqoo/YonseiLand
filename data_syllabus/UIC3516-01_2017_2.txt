We will examine several fiction genres, stories, authors and themes to outline 
the range and depth of short fiction. It is of course impossible to survey 
the entire gamut of fiction, but this class will examine several of the main 
genre functions and some of its best proponents. We will be starting workshops 
soon after the start of the semester, in addition to lectures on the stories. 
The workshop schedule will be finalized once the class roster is finalized, 
and then you will be assigned particular dates for your stories. YOU MUST 
SUBMIMIT YOUR WORKSHOP MATERIALS A WEEK BEFORE YOUR WORKSHOP. FAILURE TO DO SO 
WILL IMPACT YOUR GRADE.
