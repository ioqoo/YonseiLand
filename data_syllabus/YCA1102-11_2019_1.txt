This course aims to investigate not only the major biblical themes but also interpret the various issues of our modern society from the Christian perspectives. We will examine the ways in which the meanings of the Bible are produced and which methods best support the meanings through examinations of the world behind the text, the world within the text and the world before the text. The course is designed to help students to reflect on these three different worlds and to enable them to analyze as well as participate in the process of making a meaning in our society.
