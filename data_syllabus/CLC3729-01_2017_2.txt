The beginnings of cinematic art are somewhat shabby. Originating in the early twentieth-century peep shows and nickelodeons, the cinema, was long kept at arm’s length by the literary academy. What is more, although a number of prominent American writers did try their hand at screenplay writing, their experience of the sometimes cavalier priorities of Hollywood did not enhance the artistic case for the literary film very far. Nonetheless, in spite of the commercial priorities of cinema, there has been a strong, if sometimes submerged, tradition of literary cinema. On this course, we will investigate both the US tradition and the British tradition. We will look at the relationship between the literary text and the filmic variant. On the first half of the course, A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), My Fair Lady (1964), Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961), and Don’t Look Now (1973). On the second half of the course, we will look at The Great Gatsby (1974), Portrait of a Lady (1996), The Talented Mr Ripley (1999), and Blue Jasmine (2013).
