* Purpose
The main objective of this course is to understand the basic theories and
principles on mechanical behavior of structure, and to acquire skills to 
analysis a range of structures. Various structural analysis methods will be 
introduced throughout the course. The course is aimed at applying the 
structural analysis methods to realistic design processes.

* Summary
- Basic principles and theories of structural calculation; reaction, member
force and displacement in statically determinate structure (rods, beams,
trusses, frames, arches, cables).
- Comparative analysis of indeterminate structure; force & displacement method
(statically indeterminate beams, trusses, frames, arches).
- Moving loads and influence lines in structure.
- Matrix analysis method using stiffness method (including computer 
programming).

This course is designed for senior studuents in Civil and Environmental 
Engineering. The course covers the analysis methods for statically determinate,
and indetermindate structures. Analysis methods for various types of 
structures such as trusses, beams, and frames will be discussed throughout the 
semester. During the lectures, methods for obtaining internal forces and 
deflections for designing structures will be presented. Matrix analysis method 
suitable for computer approch to solve complex structural analysis problems 
will also be presented.
