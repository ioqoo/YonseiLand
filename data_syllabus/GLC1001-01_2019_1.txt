GLC English I will enable students to effectively integrate basic strategies and four skills to improve English proficiency. Students will be able to clearly identify the main idea, key words, and major points through listening and reading practices. Through extensive exercises, students will also develop their speaking and writing skills at the sentence level. Hopefully, by the end of the students should have the fundamental English skills to take the GLC English II course the following semester.
