In this seminar course we will read closely both the film texts and screenplays of Bruce Lee`s entire cinematic oeuvre (five films, one posthumous) in
order to look deeply into the culture, history and philosophy behind the martial art known as Kung Fu. Central to our investigations will be inquiry into
the development of the genre as a vehicle for cross-cultural (East-West) influence and inspiration, its etymological origins in habitus (skill achieved
through practice), as well as Asian masculinity, femininity, and the challenges and possibilities of the Asian male film star for Western audiences.
