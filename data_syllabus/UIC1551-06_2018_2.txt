The subtitle for this course is Words, Images, and Confucian Ideologies in Premodern Korea. This course examines premodern Korean art history from the perspective of gender studies. We will study how gender roles and identities were socially constructed and how concepts relating to gender have been continuously reconstituted throughout the Joseon dynasty. Students will learn about the political, social, and cultural changes based on the Confucian social values and how it affected the representation of Joseon men and women through words and images. Throughout the course we will see various genres of paintings and discuss the didactic role of art in propagating the Confucian ideologies in Joseon. Each lecture will present images of the artifacts and students must be prepared to use the required readings to discuss the objects within their philosophical, social, and cultural context. In this class, students will have a heavy reading requirement, several writing assignments, and presentations. By the end of the course, students will be able to convey their thoughts about art using various analytical tools and learn to express their ideas effectively both verbally and in writings.
Since this course is linked as a CBL (Community Based Learning) course, students will have the opportunity to participate and contribute in the "Bridging People through Art Project" at the Songpa Yesul Maru in Jamsil, Seoul. Students will be visiting several museums and the Songpa Yesul Maru space for the project on Saturdays (TBA). This grand project is supported by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and thus the students will be guided by both the instructor and the project leaders during the fieldwork.
