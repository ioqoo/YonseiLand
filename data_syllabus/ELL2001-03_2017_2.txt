DISCLAIMER: This is a TENTATIVE online syllabus subject to change prior to the 
beginning of the course. A more detailed syllabus will be 
provided on the first day of class.

This course is designed to help you develop the skills necessary for academic 
writing. You will be introduced to college- level rhetorical skills through 
reading, writing, and discussion. You will practice the essentials of writing 
for audience and purpose with an emphasis on critical thinking, writing 
persuasively, and with style. These skills provide a necessary foundation for 
success throughout your college career. In this course you will analyze and 
critique the rhetorical strategies and ideas used by both professional writers 
as well as your peers. Your success in this course requires not only that you 
complete the assigned readings and writing assignments, but also that you 
participate actively in the class and develop process-oriented strategies for 
writing effective essays for a variety of purposes. Emphasis will be placed on 
paragraph organization, development, coherence, unity of focus, and 
consideration of audience and purpose. Assignments, discussions, and writing 
exercises will be conducted both in class and online (YSCEC). You 
are expected to actively participate in both formats. 
This course will center on the theme of "minority voices." This theme 
will be reflected in our course readings in which you will read and analyze non-
fiction prose by diverse authors in order to raise your awareness in different 
forms and functions of rhetoric. In addition to regular in- and out-of-class 
reading and writing assignments, you are required to write two major essays: a 
summary/strong response essay and an argumentative synthesis essay.
