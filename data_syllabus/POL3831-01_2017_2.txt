The course will explore the cosmopolitan ideal in contemporary political 
theory and practice.   The first half of the course will present the idea of 
cosmopolitanism in relation to theoretical debates on patriotism and 
nationalism and then in relation to dynamics surrounding international 
migration, global civil society and transnational advocacy networks.  The 
second half of the course will apply understandings of cosmopolitanism to 
selected global issues, such as nuclear proliferation, environmental 
protection and climate change, world poverty, global governance and regional 
collaboration.
