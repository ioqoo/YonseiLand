Around the world today, people are challenging and revising the legacy of the twentieth century. The meaning of the past and its impact on the present-day has gained focus with important recent global changes and transitions. By taking this class, students will learn how studying about the past can help us to understand our complex reality. 

This class will combine lectures, discussions, and group work to help students engage with issues and explore problems using historical thinking and methods. In the process of our learning, we will explore major themes of the twentieth century, from imperialism, nationalism, and modernism, to war, mass society, decolonization, and globalization. 

The design of this class integrates content learning with the acquisition of skills. I hope that by the end of the class, students will gain a better understanding of the ways in which history can inform the way we think about the present, and have the confidence to be able to apply the skills that they have acquired in a wider context.
