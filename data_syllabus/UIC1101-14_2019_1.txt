What does it mean to come of age? How has literature shaped our understanding of youth and the experience of growing up? Does coming-of-age gain different meaning in today’s globalized world? As a genre about socialization, the Bildungsroman has held a central presence within literary studies for addressing such questions. Focusing on coming-of-age stories of the late twentieth and twenty-first century, this course explores how contemporary writers have re-envisioned the Bildungsroman in order to address the experience of growing up in diverse cultural and social contexts. Particular attention will be given to the ways problems of growing up intersect with questions about gender, sexuality, race, class, and multilingualism.    

As a writing-intensive seminar, this course will also be dedicated to developing students’ writing skills ? with the understanding that good writing comes from good reading. Students will learn how to: (a) effectively use preparatory writing strategies, such as drafting, revising, and workshopping; (b) form arguments and select textual evidence based on careful reading and analyses of texts; (c) present ideas clearly and coherently; (d) responsibly handle primary and secondary sources using MLA Style.
