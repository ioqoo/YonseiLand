In the Freshman Writing Intensive Seminar (FWIS) you will build and refine crucial self-assessment skills that will allow you to become a better academic writer and reader. Throughout the semester, you will be given opportunities to practice important writing techniques that prioritize clarity and effective delivery. In effect, the course will offer instruction on how to construct highly readable sentences and paragraphs that communicate the right or intended message to the reader.

We will first work towards gaining better critical abilities in recognizing whether a text - including our own - coheres or not. We will achieve this through continued reading and through regular workshops, which will expose us to examples that we can examine collaboratively. We will learn to shape our sentences and paragraphs into argumentative structures by imbuing them with meaning and direction. In time, we will learn to write in a way that is not only clear, but demonstrates purpose and deliberate ideas.
