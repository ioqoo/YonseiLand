Ghost Stories: The Ethics and Politics of Memory

To live in the aftermath of trauma is to live as “ghosts”--out of place and out of time, floating in a perpetual past within the present; it is, also, to live with “ghosts”--incessantly haunted by memories that refuse to stay buried. How, then, does one live as or with “ghosts”? When the sheer violence of an event shatters any sense of subjectivity and intelligibility, how does one re-member one-self? 

Moreover, in that the individual always already exists within the social, how are personal re-collections of “ghosts” further complicated by the ultimate social--the nation? When the nation claims the event for its own politics, wrenching, subordinating it from the individual, how does one navigate the haunted terrain between ethical responsibility and self-erasure? How does one console and mourn the “ghost”--to speak the unspeakable?    

This course will examine “ghost stories,” wherein “ghosts” signify, both figuratively and literally, those who “live” in the shadows of tortured, distorted, untold, and silenced memory. We will analyze novels (including graphic novels) from a variety of cultures to understand the role “ghosts” play in re-collecting voice and identity. Investigating the complex processes involved in negotiating past/present, memory/history, self/nation, we will address how to re-present and pass on as knowledge a constellation of contesting stories.
