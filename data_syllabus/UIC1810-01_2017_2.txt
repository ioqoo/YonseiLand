##
This course is to help students increase communication skills (both speaking 
and written) in the Japanese language. Students are able to learn practical 
Japanese along with necessary grammar and critical cross-cultural issues. 
While we do teach grammatical patterns and Kanji as normally done in a course 
of this kind, we emphasize learning how to communicate in real lifelike 
situations. Goals are to be able to utilize Japanese language depending on 
situations you face to when you visit Japan and talk to Japanese people.
