Information Systems & Information society

This course helps students see the connection between information systems (IS) 
and business performance. The use of information and communication 
technologies (ICT) by individuals and organisations dominates the business 
world. There is a fundamental change going on in the way that organisations 
run businesses and interact with each other. New types of infrastructure and 
applications are developed and utilized such as ERP (enterprise resource 
planning), IOS (inter-organisational systems), RFID (radio frequency 
identification), CRM (customer relationship management), to name a few. 

The aim of the course is to enable students to assess the opportunities and 
problems that managers in a wide range of organisations face as they attempt 
to use these IT applications to add value to their businesses. It also aims to 
help students understand transformational changes within and across 
industries. These changes have strategic implications for many businesses.
