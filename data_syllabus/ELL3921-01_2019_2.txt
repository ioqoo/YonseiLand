The English-speaking cultures scattered all around the globe have been created by those who have read, honored, or at least carried the English Bible. The sacred Book was read as a literal and popular authority in Britain and its colonies on moral, spiritual and existential questions of good and evil. self and society, life and death for some four centuries from the Reformation to World War II (and in parts of the U.S., even to this very moment). Yet it was in early modern Britain, inter alia, that the Bible was regarded as the most central authority in the formation of public discourses and intellectual cultures. The Book served as a foremost reference book for writers and statesmen on a wide range of earthly issues of law, politics, economics and science; they drew on the Book for a reservoir of wisdom and truth when faced with such questions as fall and redemption, dominion and obedience, republic and monarchy, private property and land (re)distribution and even marriage and divorce. Looking closely at the ways in which they interpreted, appropriated and summoned the Bible to frame their arguments via various literary genres can help to understand the importance of the Book in the intellectual heritage of English literature in the early modern period. Yet in this particular era, the Bible also stood behind some of the greatest monuments of English literature, some of whom, such as [The Pilgrimâ€™s Progress], exercised a huge emotional and spiritual power over its readers supplementing or even competing with the Bible itself. This course explores and celebrates the unique importance of the English Bible, in particular, the King James Bible (King James Version, as it is called in the U.S.) by reading parts of the Bible and a select list of masterpieces of English literature that have close 
relationship to it.
