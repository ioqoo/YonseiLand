This course is designed to introduce students to the wide range of 
opportunities and threats that have opened up with the advent of the 
information age. Students will come to understand holistically how 
cybersecurity connects to a wide range of issue areas in international 
security (military, economic, social, etc), and how the digitization of 
information leads to new vulnerabilities that traditional Security Studies has 
never faced before. This will give students a head start when they inevitably 
have to deal with cyber-related issues throughout their careers.
