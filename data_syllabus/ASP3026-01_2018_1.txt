The focus of our readings and discussion will be on religious practice, rather than doctrine. The readings are organized around three “spatial” conceptions: first, intimate publics (e.g. at a concert hall), then the politicized Square (광장), and finally, individual consciousness. We will examine, for example, the (largely) Protestant practice of vocal singing (s?ngak). What is behind the assumption that a “clean” voice ? singing in a European-style classical voice ? uniquely embodies modernity, normative aspirations, and Christian faith? In terms of (mostly) non-Christian mortuary rituals at certain gravesites, when and how are some Leftist ancestors reclaimed as family? Turning to the explicitly political space of the Square, our readings include a first-person narrative of Rev. Cho Hwa-sun who organized women workers in the Inch?n area, as well as essays on Protestant Christianity, anticommunism, and homophobia. Finally, as spiritual (mindful) practice, we will look at how Son [Zen] Buddhist monks practice meditation. Obviously, this course does not attempt a comprehensive overview of religious practice in contemporary South Korea. Our aim is to examine specific, sometimes exceptional people and practices that provide some purchase on the dynamic history, diversity, and logic of religious practices in contemporary South Korea.
