“Scarcely any political question arises…that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a judicial question.” Alexis de Tocqueville

What is the ‘law?’ What informs it? When is it ‘valid’ and why do we respect it? How is the law different from an autocrat’s commands? Are law and ‘justice’ always the same? If not, do we have a duty to respect the law? To address these and related questions, we consider the law’s nature, norms, and justifications. Our core question is: What is institutionally and morally classified as the ‘law?’ 

Our approach is interdisciplinary and covers major twentieth- and twenty-first century schools of legal philosophy, especially Legal Positivism, Natural Law, American Legal Realism, and Critical Legal Studies. 

WE CONSIDER THE LAW’S PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS THROUGH SIX MODULES: 

(1) WHAT IS THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW AND WHY DO WE CARE? 
(2) LEGAL POSITIVISM 
(3) NATURAL LAW AND OTHER CRITICS OF POSITIVISM  
(4) EXCLUSIVE v. INCLUSIVE POSITIVISM
(5) SOCIOLOGICAL ? (US) REALISM SCHOOLS
(6) CRITICAL LEGAL STUDIES

We approach each topic with explanatory text, original text, lectures, and class discussions. I will introduce topics with a lecture (including PPTs), and then we will discuss some leading literature in the field. Periodically, we will hold student moot courts where we will apply class materials to debate issues. Students may introduce ‘real-world’ events, so that we may consider practical applications. Students will question assumptions, critique and develop arguments, evaluate normative claims, originate ideas, and become better prepared to confront complex social problems. They will improve analytical, writing, discussion, and presentation skills.
