Of Life and Death: Biopolitics, Gender, and Culture

Michel Foucault`s concept of biopolitics stands as one of today`s most compelling sociocultural theories informing the relationship between power and life. As the combination of disciplinary and excitatory practices aimed at the body, biopolitics describes the calculus of costs and benefits through which the biological capacities of the individual body--aggregated into a collective population--is optimally managed and regulated for state ends. In that the practices of biopolitics involve particularized subject identities and categorized bodies, it becomes necessary to engage the analytical concept of gender with biopolitics.

This course begins with an examination of Foucault`s concept of biopolitics. Studying various political, social, and cultural theorists, including Hannah Arendt, Giorgio Agamben, Judith Butler, Robert Esposito, Cary Wolfe, we will question how biopolitics shapes lives. We will then examine diverse materials across literature, film, art, photography to explore how biopolitics (im)materialize in culture--in gendered ways. Approached from a biopolitical perspective, gender allows us to problematize not only questions of representation but also mechanisms of power. 

Through our texts, we will ask: How are lives gendered--to be normalized, managed, and regulated? Can certain lives elude, confound, or exceed gender normativity so as to defy the logic of biopolitics? How are some lives made vulnerable and bestial--thus, disposable? How does biopolitics constitute gender as a category in order to include some lives as belonging while consigning others to ultimate un-belonging--death? How do humans (and animals) resist and remedy states of precariousness to imagine the possibility of living otherwise? What, ultimately, does it mean to "live" as "gendered" in our biopolitical age?
