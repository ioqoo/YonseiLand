##
A topological space is a set which is equipped with the notions of open subsets (and hence, continuous functions on it). 
We shall learn important properties of topological spaces such as compactness and connectedness, and discuss how they behave under continuous transforms.
For details, see the weekly plan show below (it could vary depending on your feedback as we proceed.)
