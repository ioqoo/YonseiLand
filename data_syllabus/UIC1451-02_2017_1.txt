Tanizaki Jun’ichiro is one of Japan’s literary giants, on par with Kawabata Yasunari and ?e Kenzabur?, the two Japanese Nobel laureates in literature. Tanizaki is especially (in)famous for his strikingly erotic imagination, ranging from directly corporeal inscriptions of desire (e.g., tattoos) to the self-consciously dramatic staging of phantasies. This course will introduce students to three of the most celebrated of Tanizaki’s novels, supplementing them with film adaptations when available. This course requires on average 100 pages of reading per week, which will be in turn entertaining, provocative, and absorbing. Students should be ready to read carefully and engage in critical interpretation. 

N.B.
*Tanizaki’s texts contain descriptions of sexual acts and affects.
