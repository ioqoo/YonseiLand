The purpose of this course is to facilitate in-depth understanding of the historical, literary, and theological aspect of the Acts of the Apostles. To begin with, the course will explore the ancient Greek, Roman, and Jewish world as a backdrop. Students will also hone in interpretive skills by drawing on the narrative and theological dimension of Acts.

Students will learn rudimentary skills with the purpose of critically reading and interpreting the Gospel. To this end, students will learn to: (1) detect the different perspectives residing in different world views, Jewish or Greco-Roman; (2) practice biblical interpretation in the historical, literary, and theological contexts; (3) critically, but respectfully, listen to diverse voices
