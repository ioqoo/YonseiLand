We will mainly study the cultural exchanges through art in East Asian region pertaining to the period between the 14th to 19th centuries.

First of all, we will survey the art theory and issues of ceramics, Buddhist art and traditional paintings in order to understand historical events and cultural contexts. And then, we will also deal with the cultural exchanges between Joseon Korea and her neighboring countries through group work. 

There were two international policies, Serving the Great(“Sadae”) and Maintaining Amicable Relations(“Kyorin”) during the Joseon dynasty(1392-1910). Encountering an unfamiliar culture and new experience brought vivid changes to the Joseon society. Through the group works and the analysis of reading articles, we will research the changes in the aspects of visual culture and acquire a deeper understanding of Korea-China or Korea-Japan cultural exchanges and relations.

Finally, we will make the design and plan for small special exhibitions on the basis of these topics and submit a brief personal essay related to the exhibitions.
