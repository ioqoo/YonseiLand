First adopted by movie studios as a promotional scheme for new films, the film music came into public consciousness with the advent of so-called "soundtrack albums" in the late 1940s. These commercially available recordings were soon termed "film score" and (or) "original motion picture soundtrack" and eventually became an integral part of the film industry and also the music industry.

Not only does film music enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact for films, it also works as a perfect marketing tool to promote them, as most movie theme songs or soundtracks have been composed, produced, and recorded by some of the most prominent names in contemporary music. 

This course explores the aesthetics and the history of music in film. Following a loose chronology, we will discuss its history from various cultural, artistic and production perspectives. We will watch clips from early Hollywood films to the most current and discuss how music functions within films throughout history.
