This course aims to provide basic introduction to some of the issues that are central to understanding present-day Korean society. It does so by drawing linkages between the past starting with the Chosun period [1392-1910] (through then contemporary materials or academic studies of the past) and the present. Strong emphasis will be placed on forces of social change. Topics to be discussed include culture and society of traditional Korea, the colonial period, rapid modernization, and current society. The course also touches on contemporary social issues. After this course, students will understand Koreans and their culture better.
