Course Objective:  
   The goal of this course is to study theoretical backgrounds and principles 
in building mechanical and electrical system in order to expand the 
understanding about the control for indoor environment in architecture. Topic 
will include theoretical review in heat transfer, energy, HVAC and electric 
lighting system design for the practical applications of building system in 
architecture. Theoretical calculation methods will be employed to optimize the 
influence of environmental factor in architecture.

Course Format :
This course will include a combination of lectures and case studies for 
specific discussion topics each week. Discussion is open to all students in 
class. Students are expected to participate in the discussion. Interaction 
between students and instructor will be useful. 

Assignment :
Individual projects on theoretical calculation and system design will be 
assigned. It will require a project report that includes detailed information 
on each design criteria, equipment selection, system layout, analysis. 
Presentation for each project will be mandatory. Homework will be given.

Grading :
- Midterm project: 40 %,     - Homework: 20 %,      - Final Project: 40 %,    
- Attendance: Very critical
