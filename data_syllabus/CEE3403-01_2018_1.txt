Lesson Objective;
 Soil and rock are among the most important civil engineering materials. They form the foundations of all structures, can be rearranged to provide a topography to suit particular needs like embankments for road and railways, can form a structure in its own right when used for levee banks or dam walls, or may need to be removed to allow access such as with tunnels and cuttings. 
 Students completing this unit should understand how to make simplifications to complex soil conditions, how to establish strength/deformation characteristics of the soil and how to apply fundamental geo-mechanics knowledge learned in earlier units to solve problems involving the stability of an earth mass for these various situations.

- Understanding of basic soil mechanics  
- Investigate geotechnical engineering principles 
- Recognize the soil mechanics and understanding of its behavior
