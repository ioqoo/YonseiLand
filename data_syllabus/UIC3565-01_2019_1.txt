In this course, "Modern China: Changing Business Cultures," we examine how modern businesses emerged in China during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in a context of domestic political conflict and international imperial expansion. We first examine the type of businesses--often family-owned, and relying on networks of personal relationships--that predominated in China before the introduction of international forms. Next we examine the changes in how businesses were organized and run that occurred together with, and influenced, other aspects of political and cultural modernization during the first half of the 20th century. Finally, we see how these changes helped to shape business outside mainland China.
