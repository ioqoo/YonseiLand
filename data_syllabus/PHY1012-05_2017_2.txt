##
This is a calculus based physics course for students of the college of 
egineering covering electrostatics (such as the electric force, the electric 
field, Gauss’s law, electric potential, capacitors and dielectrics), 
electromotive force, current and circuits, the magnetic field, Ampere’s law, 
Faraday’s law, inductance, electromagnetic oscillations, alternating currents, 
Maxwell’s equations, electromagnetic waves, geometrical optics, interference 
and diffraction.
Experiments include Millikan oil drop, the magnetic field, e/m ratio of 
charged particles, L-R-C circuits, Interference/Diffraction and Polarization 
of light, the photoelectric effect diffractometry.
Measurements of physical quantities in some of Experiments can be done via 
computer interfaced data acquisition system. All experimental equipments and 
apparatus are highly sophisticated.
With a prior notice, the Lab schedule can be changed depending on Lab 
conditions.
Written laboratory reports including data reduction and error analysis are 
required and should be submitted within a week after each experiment
