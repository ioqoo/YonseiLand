2. Goals
The Peer Tutoring Program aims to provide quality, course-specific academic 
support to ISED & LSBT students at no cost. Tutoring sessions are tailored to 
aid the studentsâ€™ learning and to attend to their individual needs and 
concerns. Ideal tutors are those who have excelled in the course, well 
familiar with the course content, and have commendable study skills and habits.
 
They are expected to:
- Provide academic support to an assigned UIC freshman through tutoring 
- Assist the assigned tutee in adapting to college life
- Cultivate a spirit for service and sharing
