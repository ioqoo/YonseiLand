Course Description:

This course is designed to provide a concept and working knowledge of 
nanomaterials. It is also designed to learn how to approach nanomaterials 
scientifically and/or technically for an engineering application.

Course Goals:

- Obtain an overall (basic) understanding of the phenomena occurring in 
nanoscale materials.
- Obtain a concept and working knowledge of nanomaterials.
- Obtain an understanding of the size effect on the physical-, chemical and 
mechanical properties of materials.
- Learn in advanced technology for synthesis, characterization and application 
of nanomaterials. 
- Apply concept and knowledge of nanomaterials, with emphasis on nanomaterials 
as an engineering tool.
