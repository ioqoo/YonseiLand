Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-81) and The Idiot (1868-69)

Can perfect goodness be imagined? For a mortal being? The Idiot is Fyodor Dostoevsky`s attempt to create a portraiture of a perfectly good man. In our times when humanity as such is being interrogated against the background of the overwhelming effects of science and technology, this course invites students to reflect on not only what it means to be a human being but how he/she can be good. There is no debate on Dostoevsky`s status as one of the greatest writers in the world history of literature. His works inspired some of the greatest minds in modernity, from Friedrich Nietzsche to Sigmund Freud to Albert Camus, and influenced their creative and theoretical works. The course will offer an introduction not only to the world of Dostoevsky through a weekly reading of The Idiot and occasional screenings of films based on his novels, but also to ways in which literature can be read beyond oneâ€™s immediate reaction. Students should be ready to read attentively and articulate their ideas actively.
