Empathy has been traditionally one of the key-concepts referred to by scholars in order to understand the novel’s particular kind of cognitive, aesthetic, and social work. By reading two texts that are able to elicit strong and qualitatively different empathic responses in readers, Gustave Flaubert’s "Madame Bovary" and Louis-Ferdinand Celine’s "Journey to the End of the Night," and by discussing classic and contemporary readings in the theory of empathy, the seminar will explore the connections between empathy and the novel and reflect upon the importance of the idea of empathy for literary studies.
