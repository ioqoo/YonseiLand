This seminar course investigates Paul’s theology as it pertains to political life in todays’ civil society. To do so, the course will have three main stages. To begin with, the course will explore the concept of political theology from a historical, social, and cultural perspective. Second, the course will give an overview of Paul’s undisputed letters. Third, the course will take a closer look at the exemplar works of the philosophers (e.g., Carl Schmitt, Paul W. Kahn, Alain Badiou, Jacob Taubes, Giorgio Agamben, and Slavoj ?i?ek) who have engaged critically with Paul’s letters and his theology. 

The course is designed to provide an analytical and hermeneutical framework for students to discuss, reflect upon and understand Paul’s letters in critical conversation with political theology in the area of intersection between politics and the church.
