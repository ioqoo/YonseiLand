The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to key issues in the interdisciplinary field of comparative and international education (CIE) with a focus on education and development. In the first part of the course, we examine the key debates defining the parameters of comparative and international education, the concept of educational opportunity and education for all, and mass educational expansion. We next focus on educational problems in developing countries. We explore the role of international institutions such as World Bank, UN, or OECD as well as that of international aid. Notably, we cover issues of educational quality, equality and equity, gender, and children at risk (for instance, in post-conflict settings). Lastly, we focus on policy issues and the practical value of research, international large-scale assessments such as PISA, policy borrowing and educational reforms, and how globalization and international discourses can affect national policies. 

Students will gain a deeper understanding of the philosophical and practical issues governing the field, and be trained to critically read studies from an interdisciplinary body of literature specific to Comparative and International Education.
