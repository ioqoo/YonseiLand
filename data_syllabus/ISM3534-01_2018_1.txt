This class will be an examination of the relationship between constitutions 
and “peoplehood.” We are accustomed to thinking that the people are the 
authors of constitutions. But when we ask who the people are, or where they 
came from, the answer will remain incomplete unless we take into account the 
role of the constitution in defining (even creating) the identity of the 
people. In some cases, the very act of making a constitution was also an act 
of defining who the people (really) are. In order to interrogate this puzzle, 
the class will start by probing into the status of the various “peoples”in 
whose name constitutions are made and enforced. This will first require an 
understanding of the terms constitution and constitutionalism. It will also 
involve a study of the concepts of popular sovereignty and representation in 
historical contexts. 
Since constitutions are typically made as a statement of the establishment of 
a new political order, we will next turn to the idea of political founding and 
see how constitutions figure in that process. This means asking questions like 
“If a new constitution is made, does that mean a new political community has 
come into being?” This will require an understanding of the relationship 
between constitutions and political continuity and change. Again, the 
underlying question is whether constitutions bring about a new people. 
Even after the act of political founding, or constitution-making, the identity 
of the people continues to be affected by the constitution. Sometimes, 
constitutions may set limits on political changes allowed within the political 
community. At other times, constitutions may embody a desire to bring about 
certain changes in the identity of the people. 
In sum, this course is designed to help students think critically about the 
constitution in relation to the political dynamics of the "making of a people."
