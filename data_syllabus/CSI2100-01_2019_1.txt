This course introduces students to the techniques, tools and thought processes that computer scientists apply to solve problems. The course will particularly highlight the role of computation for solving real-world problems. Students will be introduced to the two major abstraction principles in computer science: algorithms and data-structures.
Weekly schedule:
- Lecture: 2 hours
- Lab: 2 hours, used for programming practice, quiz and individual student code-counseling by TAs; part of the lab time may be used for additional lectures.
   ·  Each week, students receive a problem set (``Lab’’) which consists of programming problems and short-answer questions to be solved and handed in until the following week (13 labs in total).
The implementation language of this course is Python 3.
