This course is designed to expose undergradate students to 
diverse texts loosely grouped under the category of postcolonial
literature. We will start with two movies about Australian aborigines
and how this racial Other is portrayed. Then we will compare 
these movies with another movie about South African whites and 
blacks under the apartheid years. After or between 
these movie sessions, we will proceed to read stories by Nadine 
Gordimer and J. M. Coetzee, the Nobel laureates of 1991 and 2003, 
along with one by La Guma. We are going to raise and attempt to 
answer fundamental questions concerning the relationship between 
novel and society, such as how society influences literature and how 
the latter responds to the former. Then we will turn to another issue 
of Western representation of Asian, another hot issue in literary criticism 
of today. We will discuss a work by Chang-rae Lee in the context of 
Korean American legacy and global literature.
