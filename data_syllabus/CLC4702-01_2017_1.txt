This course adopts an interdisciplinary approach which combines literary criticism, history, and geography, to read those classical works with close 
connection to celebrated Western cities (and one work offering a fantasy of cities), from the classical era (Rome) through middle ages (Florence) to the modern period (London, Paris, New York, and Venice). London and Paris occupy central positions, historically and culturally, as rival ("commercial-
apolitical" vs. "cultural-politicized") models of the metropolis. What we gain from this literary, historical, and topographical excursion, apart from a greater intimacy with the cities, is a critical self-knowledge of where and how we live. For the modern metropolis is where we live, loving and hating it, but never quite able to be free from its domination.
