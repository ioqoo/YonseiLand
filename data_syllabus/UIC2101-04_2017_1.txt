The aim of this course is to introduce students to logic ? the study of good reasoning ? in three different ways: by introducing them to (a) informal logic, (b) formal logic, and (c) the philosophy of logic. We’ll begin by reviewing basic principles of a particular kind of reasoning ? deductive reasoning ? as well as some fundamental principles of intellectually responsible debate. Then, most of the remainder of the course will be devoted to mastering the fundamentals of a mathematical apparatus ? formal or symbolic logic ? used to represent basic features of the deductive reasoning we do using ordinary language. To help us understand the conceptual foundations of formal logic, we’ll also read and discuss some classic texts in the philosophy of logic. And, the last few lectures of the class will concern the influence of symbolic logic on 20th century science and mathematics.
