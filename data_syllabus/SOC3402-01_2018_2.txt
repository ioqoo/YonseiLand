This undergraduate course provides a comparative and theoretical introduction 
to the recent social transformation of East Asian societies. In the first 
half, we will study the reform and opening up of "Actually Existing Socialism" 
in China. For this, we will read the theories of Marx and Lenin to make sense 
of issues in post-socialist transformation. Socialism in theory by Marx and 
Lenin used to be an alternative vision to western, liberal capitalism to some 
countries, but socialism in reality has been disasterous and almost 
disappeared on earth. The topics of working class politics, human rights and 
democracy, resistance and struggle from below, and globalization will be 
discussed.

In the second half, we will move to the topics of gender and citizenship. For 
this, we will read a few articles by contemporary feminists, then examine the 
contemporary issues faced by women and minority in East Asia. In this part, we 
will collectively examine and grapple with the problem of social exclusion and 
discrimination in East Asia today.
