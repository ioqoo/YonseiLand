This course is the primary first term writing class for all incoming students to the UIC program. The course will conclude with an extended research project in consultation with the instructor, and it will require the use of English language sources as well as documentation.  Throughout the semester, we will be reading supplementary material, including formal critical essays and journalism.  The purpose is to enhance the sophistication of the writing through conjoining practice of reading.  The course, therefore, assumes the inseparability of both reading and writing. This course requires extensive writing and is quite difficult, though not impossible for diligent, committed students.

Theme:  Our focus for this term is writing about film with a deep emphasis on film interpretation and understanding. Accordingly, we have chosen two books that deal with film. One of the books is focused on writing about film, including the processes of focusing on subject matter and developing ideas. The other book is about reading film, including classic techniques of cinematic analysis. Thus, we will practice various forms of interpretation, including the application of literary terminology, image analysis, and critical cultural concepts. In order to carry out our work, we practice three different writing tasks, including a more basic film analysis essay, a summary paragraph of a published film analysis, and an extensive research paper on a particular film. With regard to the film analysis and research essay, students will be in charge of selecting their own films to analyze. Films should be rich enough in content and imagery to allow for an extended essay on them. If you are not interested in focusing on film for the writing assignments for our class, please consider dropping it and enrolling in another section of the course.
