This course offers a comparative study and close reading of the major heroic 
epics of ancient Greece and Rome: Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey (Greece), and 
Virgil’s Aeneid (Rome). We will be discussing some key topics: the warrior 
ethic, the distinction between kleos (glory) and time (honor), heroic 
friendship, of nostos (homecoming), fate and the gods, oral vs. written 
poetry, 
the social function of epic, myth and epic, and the changing nature of 
heroism. 
We will also explore more closely the themes of rebribution and justice, as 
they are very starkly presented in Aeschylus`s _Agamemnon_, and of human and 
divine concepts of justice in Sophocles`s _Antigone_.
