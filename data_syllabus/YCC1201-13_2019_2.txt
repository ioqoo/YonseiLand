Students are required to attend every class. One free tardy is allowed and any late, thereafter, will result in a 1% deduction off of the final grade. Each absence for every lecture hour is worth 2% off of the final grade. 
More information will be provided in class during Week 01. Please be present. For those students who decide to join the class during the add/drop period, I strongly encourage you to backtrack and read through the PPT for the missed weeks.
