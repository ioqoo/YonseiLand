After the 2011 Fukushima disaster, many scholars of Japanese studies began to reexamine the period understood as “postwar Japan” (sengo), seeking to make sense of the event and the subsequent revelation of the collapse of existing systems and values that had largely been shaped in the years after World War II. Inspired by such a recent intellectual current, this course explores historical narratives of Japan after WWII with a specific focus on politics and culture, broadly conceived. By closely examining a few representative works in the field, including John Dower’s Embracing Defeat and Norma Field’s In the Realm of a Dying Emperor, the course aims to provide a nuanced understanding of international and domestic political contestations in postwar Japan and their associated cultural practices and expressions. Students are expected to both critically engage with historical narratives produced in a specific ideological context and challenge their own assumptions of politics and culture in general.
