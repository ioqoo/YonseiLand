We are living in an age of mass waste. Disposability has recently increased dramatically to the extent that exceeds the earth’s ecological carrying capacity. This requires a new and critical conception of the value of the things. Does garbage represent the state of “value-zero”? How is this “valuelessness” defined? This course explores, first, social and institutional dynamics of attaching values to things (and detaching values from things), and the way for things and recourses to be systemically retreated from useful circulation. Secondly, this course deals with social systems of managing toxins and wastes, focusing on massive infrastructure and built environment especially in urban spaces. Thirdly, this course studies human relations affected by the production and disposal of waste, with special attention to the issues of inequity and injustice. This includes power relations and information asymmetry regarding toxic wastes. Finally, this course explores alternative ways of relating with things and wastes, which are ecologically sound and democratically accountable.
