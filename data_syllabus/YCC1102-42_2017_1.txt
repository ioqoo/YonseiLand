*  Mid-term and Final Exams:  These will be integrated reading and writing exams.  The exams will test your ability to identify various aspects of English paragraphs as well as reading comprehension and other skills.

*  Homework:  This score will reflect the results of your homework assignments.  Your homework must be turned in on time to receive full credit.  This means it must be printed and ready to hand in when your teacher asks for it.  Students will lose 10% of the possible points for any assignment turned in late.  If an assignment is more than 2 weeks late, it will not be accepted.  
 
*  Class Participation:  This score will reflect the amount of effort you show in class during  discussions and other activities.  To receive a high class participation score you must do your best on all in-class assignments, projects, and discussions.  When doing pair or group activities, you must work together with your partners to complete the assignment.  Asking or answering questions in class will also improve your class participation score.

*  Novel Reading Students will be required to read Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck. (Penguin Graded Reader). This novel will provide the basis for many of our class discussions and supplementary reading assignments.
