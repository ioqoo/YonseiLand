The aim of this course is to probe into the nature of the Asian-ness (or Oriental-ness) 
that informs contemporary American literary and cinematic narratives on the East. 
Throughout the semester, we will examine the diverse narrative strategies that exoticize, 
eroticize, spiritualize and even demonize the East, and ask questions about their political 
ramifications. To a certain degree, Asian American writers` narrativization of their cultural 
legacies is not an exception to this kind of marketing of Asia. This scrutiny, however, is 
not designed just to confirm the well-known Saidian insight into the hegemony of Orientalism 
but to bring to light the often-conflictual inner dynamism of the target text that bears witness 
to the limits of its own ideology, be it assimilationist or subversive.
