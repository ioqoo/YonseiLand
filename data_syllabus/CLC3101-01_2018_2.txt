Along with its rebellious philosophy and image, rock and roll music--arguably 
one of the first globally transmitted and accepted musical cultural products, 
became extremely popular with the British youth in the late 1950s. By the early 
`60s, the rock and pop music acts from the UK began to cross-over to American 
audience by throwing back rock `n` roll at America, hence creating the so-called 
"British Invasion" phenomenon. Even in the new millennium, the British Invasion 
still lingers on half a century later, either musically, culturally, or even socially. 

This course aims to provide the origin, development, and evolution of the British 
Invasion and highlights its significant performers and music styles to examine 
musical, cultural, and social impact and influence on contemporary society.
 
Beyond music, the British Invasion has expanded to cinema, fashion, and sports, 
and it has become more or less a badge of identity, pride, and legacy of the UK 
in one way or another. It will be an intriguing observation to approach this trend 
from a variety of perspectives.
