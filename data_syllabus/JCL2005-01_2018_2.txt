“Every social justice movement comes from people in small groups telling life stories and discovering similar shared experiences.”  -Gloria Steinem

We discuss seminal social justice philosophies and how they resolve the meaning of, and best way to achieve, ‘social justice.’ By exploring primarily Western, but still diverse, approaches to social justice, we also analyze contemporary issues, including intergenerational conflicts over climate change and social welfare, refugees, reparations for historic wrongs, transitional justice in South and North Korea, and feminism and ‘men’s rights.’ Our classroom will be a safe, open space to express your views. By course’s end, you should be able propose and defend your design for a socially just society. 

I will introduce topics with a lecture (including PPTs), and then we will discuss some leading literature in the field. Everyone is expected to attend class and contribute with questions and comments. Students may introduce ‘real-world’ events; and   periodically, we will debate current social justice issues. 

WE CONSIDER SOCIAL JUSTICE THROUGH TEN MODULES:
 
1) WHAT IS ‘SOCIAL JUSTICE? 
2) FIRST THOUGHTS: CLASSICAL VIEWS
3) MAXIMIZING ‘HAPPINESS’: UTILITARIANISM
4) MARKETS AND CHOICE: LIBERTARIANISM
5) A PACT FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE: LIBERALISM 
6) AS MUCH AS NEEDED: SOCIALISM & COMMUNISM
7) TALKING JUSTICE: DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY
8) COMMUNITIES & CONTEXT: COMMUNITARIANISM  
9) EXPANDING THE DEBATE: POST-MODERNISM 
10) WHAT TO DO?: REMEDIES
