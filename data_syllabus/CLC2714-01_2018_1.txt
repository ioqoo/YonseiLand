"Il faut etre de son temps" -- one must be of one`s time, Daumier famously declares, lending voice to the militant artistic movements in the mid-nineteenth century that sought to throw off establishment politics by taking on new subject matter in new ways. What does it take to be relevant, to come to grips with contemporary reality, or to deal with the stuff of modern life at large (e.g. hordes of other bodies crowding the city, a surfeit of commodities on display, endless bureaucracy, sexual performance and repression, technological innovation, and of course, violence of an unprecedented scale)? What strategies do writers use to smuggle critique into their work, and to what ends?

This course examines a wide array of texts from radical social theories to experimental poetry and prose to avant-garde screeds-- key works that compose the conceptual apparatus we have come to call "modernism."  The course is intensive; the readings are immensely rewarding but also challenging in theme and style.  We will devote a good amount of time discussing and reading closely. You will be asked to present to the class at least once during semester and to write two essays that demonstrate close-reading and argumentation skills.
