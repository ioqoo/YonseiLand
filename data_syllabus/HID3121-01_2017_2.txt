The goal of this course is to study the theoretical backgrounds and principles 
in building illumination in order to expand the understanding of lighting in 
architecture. Topic will include theoretical review in electric lighting and 
daylight for the practical applications of indoor and exterior lighting design. 
Analyses for the application of building illumination will be discussed. 
Occasionally, theoretical calculation methods will be employed to optimize the 
influence of lighting in architecture.
