This course is designed for undergraduate freshmen of the department of natural science,
 life science and biotechnology, and engineering, who need to understand and apply the 
basic techniques of calculus.  Beginning with functins and limits, this course includes
techniques and applications of differentiation, indefinite and definite integrals and simple 
analytic geometry. We will follow the order of topics in the textbook but we will still 
emphasize some topics and skip others as mentioned in the syllabus.

You should be in class on time and stay till it is over. Attendance is crucial to your grade.
 If you miss over a third of the class, you will get an F no matter what your grade is. 
Before you come to the class you`d better prepare yourself by reading the textbook
 in advance and completing your homework assignment. 
3 tests--each 100 points-- will be given as shown in the syllabus. 

I want to have TRUST and RESPECT between us.

I hope you and I have a good semester.
