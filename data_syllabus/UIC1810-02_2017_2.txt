##
This course focuses on communication. Students are able to learn practical 
Japanese along with necessary grammar and critical cross-cultural issues. While
we do teach grammatical patterns and kanji as normally done in a course of 
this kind, we emphasize learning how to communicate in real life_like 
situations. Goals are to be able to utilize Japanese language depending on 
situations you face to when you visit Japan  and talk to Japanese people.
