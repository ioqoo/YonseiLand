The overall purpose of the course is to help you develop the people skills you need to be effective employees or managers in organizations.  Specifically, course objectives are to increase your self-awareness, to help you become more skilled at analyzing behavior in organizations, and to help you learn what actions are appropriate for different managerial situations. In spite of their satisfactory technical skills, people often discover that they do not know how to work effectively with others nor have the interpersonal skills to be a good manager. This course seeks to help you understand why people behave as they do in groups and organizations. The course covers both the "micro" level phenomena (such as issues concerning individuals, interpersonal relations, and teamwork) and the "macro" level phenomena in organizations (such as organizational structure, culture and change).
