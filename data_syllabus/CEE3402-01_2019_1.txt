The goal of the course is to understand fundamental mechanisms and design 
principles of reinforced concrete (RC) structures so that students are able to 
easily adapt to changes in design methods. Topics of the course include 
behavior of structural concrete and methods for the design of individual RC 
members for bending, shear and torsion. Additionally, the course requires to 
design a concrete structure, as a term project.

##
Introduction to materials and methods of reinforced concrete construction; behavior and design of reinforced concrete beams and one-way slabs considering deflections, flexure, shear and anchorage; behavior and design of columns including slenderness effects; design of spread footings; design of lateral load resisting frames and walls for earthquake effects. Laboratory includes experiments and design sessions leading to development of a structural design project in reinforced concrete.
