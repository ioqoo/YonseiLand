There are many different martial arts in Korea. Among the martial arts in 

Korea Taekwondo has received numerous international fame and recognition. 

Taekyun, however, is the only martial art in Korea designated as a National 

Treasure (N0.76). Taekyun`s history in Korea dates back more than 3,000 years. 

Its movements and techniques embrace the heart of spirit and culture.

When practiced correctly Taekyun resembles a graceful dance sometimes slow, 

sometimes fast, while constantly remaining fluid and precise. Taekyun`s 

foundation is built upon the familiar 3/4 beat, which is commonly found in 

traditional Korean music. Combining the 3/4 beat with deep knee bends 

reminiscent of Korean traditional dancing. Taekyun appears soft and weak. 

However, Taekyun`s soft weak-like appears only add to its hidden strength and 

power.Once an opponent is lulled in by Taekyun`s graceful flow, a well 

practiced Taekyun player can pounce like a crouching tiger on its prey. 

Taekyun techniques combine precision and speed striking opponents like a bolt 

of lightning.
