BRITAIN AND THE WORLD, c.1750-1900

British history in the last 250 years has been synonymous with some of the major changes experienced around the globe. With the fallout from the 2016 Brexit referendum, Britain once again seems to be a measure of the worldâ€™s turbulence. But how did the small island of Britain ever become a world power, and what has been its relationship with the rest of the world in modern times? Moreover, how have these interactions between Britain and the world shaped the world in which we live today? The aim of this course is to provide students with the opportunity to explore these crucial contemporary questions through historical materials and methods. 

By studying this broad and expansive theme in world history, we will explore a variety of important debates, including the changing political relationship between elites and masses, the impact of technology on economics and social life, nationalist challenges to imperial ambitions, and the apparent conflict between scientific and non-scientific views of the world. Specific historical topics we will be covering include the American Revolution, the Atlantic slave trade, the Industrial Revolution, and British imperial entanglements in India and China.

The design of this class integrates content learning with the acquisition of skills. I hope that by the end of the class, students will gain a better understanding of the ways in which history can inform the way we think about the present, and have the confidence to be able to apply the skills that they have acquired in a wider context.
