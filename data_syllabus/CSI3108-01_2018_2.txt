Students learn typical problems in Computer Science and how to solve them 
efficiently with various algorithmic paradimes, such as divide-and-conquer 
algorithms, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming algorithms, linear 
programming, backtracking, branch-and-bound, genetic algorithms, simulated 
annealing and approximation algorithms. The course also deals with NP-Complete 
problems.
