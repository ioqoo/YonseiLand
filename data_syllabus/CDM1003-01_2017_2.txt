The aim of class is to help various design majored students to improve their 
artistic creativity and imagination. And also to support inter-disciplinary 
approaches in the visual art fields. Dealing with the concept of visuality, 
culture and global/local in contemporary art and design, students will improve 
their creative thinking in relation to their subject matters and ethics.
What is visual culture? In short, visual culture is best described as 
visualized existence, and is not dependent only on pictures themselves. 
However, one of the most striking features of the new visual culture is the 
growing tendency to visualize things that are not in themselves visual. 
Approaching inter-disciplinary contexts of visual culture, connecting art, 
design, science, technology, management and business administration, we will 
test out a number of thematic topics:
- Examining a wide range of visual media, including painting, sculpture, 
photography, design, television, cinema, virtual reality and the internet.
- Using a social historical approach to the visual culture of varying nations, 
societies, classes and ethnic identities.
 
-  Drawing widely on visual cultural theory and history to outline a 
provisional map of modernist culture in which questions necessary to the 
understanding of creative participation and allegorical places in society and 
culture.
 
- Use a range of visual cultural methodologies, including documentation, 
analysis of biographical information, semiotics as well as formalist study of 
works of art.
