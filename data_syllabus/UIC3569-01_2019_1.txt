UIC Seminar: Psychoanalysis and Literature (“Freud’s Case Histories”)

The relation between psychoanalysis and literature is at once evident and mysterious. As Freud defines it, a literary text is an expression of the author’s fantasies; and, as he practices it, psychoanalysis is a thoroughly narrative endeavor. It seems that literature was psychoanalysis avant la lettre; and psychoanalysis the raison d’?tre of literature. In short, any attribution of relative significance or ontological priority seems doomed as well as ill-conceived. Significantly, such affinity is not to be translated into identity. Indeed, psychoanalysis and literature continue to be productive precisely in that narrow space of proximate difference; so is it here that criticism?literary interpretation interlocked with analysis ? la psychoanalysis?thrives. With this ambiguity as the guiding principle, we will practice close reading (a literary critical act par excellence) with Freud’s most famed case histories (psychoanalytical material par excellence), with the aim of articulating the affinity-in-difference of the two most important disciplines of the modern ?poque. Be ready to encounter most intriguing expressions of the human psyche (re)presented in clinical narratives that are themselves inquisitive, obsessive, and fascinating.
