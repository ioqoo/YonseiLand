We will read four recently published monographs, two on North Korea, two on South Korea. Our aim will be to see how each work alters or deepens our understanding of some aspect of Korea’s past and present. This will be a critical endeavor in that we will consider how the author constructs the problematic (what and why of the questions being asked), the nature and scope of the evidence presented, the theoretical frame within which texts (evidence) are interpreted, and whether the narrative is compelling. While respectful of the intellectual labor that went into the work, we will consistently raise the question So what? That is, the political/ideological question that arises from the fact that historical writing is, at some level, a history of the present. 

In the first half of the course, we will read Charles Armstrong’s Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, 1950-1992, and Andrei Lankov’s The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia. In the second half of the course, we will read Carter Eckert’s Park Chung Hee and Modern Korea: The Roots of Militarism, 1866-1945, and Charles R. Kim’s Youth for Nation: Culture and Protest in Cold War South Korea. This course will be conducted as a seminar, and thus I expect students to have read the text before coming to class and to actively engage in classroom discussion.
