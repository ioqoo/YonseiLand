This course is designed to help students do the following things:  
(1) formulate a specific research question
(2) identify relevant literature and conduct a critical review of it. 
(3) select a proper method for your research question (ex. what type of sampling strategy would you choose for your research question)
(4) organize and present your research results 

Additionally, this course will touch upon things students should do and should not do in conducting their own research or, simply put, research ethics. 

This course has three main components: lecture, in-class activities, and group research project. Students will be expected to do everything required by this course as a member of a group except for the final exam. In the first week, each student will be assigned to a group consisting of 4 or 5 students. Thus, cooperation among students is key to success in this course.
