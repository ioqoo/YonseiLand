This course deals with the religious and political history of Western Europe from the 14th century through the 20th century, while especially focusing upon the history of the Reformation, emerged from their social, political, and ecclesiastical contexts, and upon that of the modern Protestant church in the highly scientific and technologically developed secular world. Our attention will be given first 1) to the theological and institutional change represented by the shift of addressing the doctrinal yet implicitly political issues, such as “Justification by Faith Alone,” “the Sacraments and Predestination,” and “Church and Society,” then reflectively 2) to the question of “how do we understand the Korean church today in the eyes of Reformers, e.g., Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and Menno Simons?” 3) How should we understand the reciprocal relations of the Protestant church with the secular world from the 17th century to the 20th century? This course is not simply intended to figure out the historical and theological features of the Reformation and the modern Protestant church, but also importantly to make a hermeneutical attempt to apply them to the problems of the present Korean church and furthermore to suggest some theological/practical ideas for the better shaping of the Korean church.
