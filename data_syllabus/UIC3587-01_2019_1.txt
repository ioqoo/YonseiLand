This course is an exploration of human sensibilities, taste and desire through a wide array of inter-disciplinary readings in cultural anthropology, literature, and theory.  One of the central focuses will be ‘beauty,’ not so much the object, but more importantly the politics surrounding its notion and manifestation. We live in an era of inundation of media that operate as means of production, dissemination and consumption of the information, images and imaginations that constitute the material and non-material aspect of our culture. We will begin with an on-line reading, “Performing the Nation” and examine how the notion of beauty operates on multiple levels in realms such as class, ethnic and national politics and cultural practices.
