Bioethics concerns ethical and policy issues surrounding life sciences research, medicine, and health policy. As technology advances, it raises ever more urgent questions about the proper division between science and biology, as new techniques make it easier than ever to produce the kinds of changes that usually take nature thousands of generations and millions of years to produce. Likewise, new medicines and procedures continually blur the line between what is an acceptable treatment and what is an unacceptable performance enhancer. Age-old questions abound as well, for example about the right to end oneâ€™s own life, or the moral status of an unborn fetus. Finally, all modern societies must deal with vexing policy issues regarding the just distribution of medical and other resources to support the health and welfare of even their poorest citizens. Although all of these issues have a distinctly ethical aspect, we will learn that the most responsible ethical positions must be heavily informed by practical understanding. Accordingly, this course will study the problems from the perspectives of philosophy, science, history, law, and economics to gain a better understanding of the real world consequences of our choices.

Target knowledge and skills to be developed:

- Understanding of the core issues in Bioethics
- Understanding the basis for making ethical and policy decisions
- Ethical and policy analysis
- Critical thinking and debate skills
- Clear and effective persuasive writing
