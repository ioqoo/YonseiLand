How do cells produce and process the biomolecules that are essential for their 
function?  Networks of chemical reactions are employed by all living things to 
convert substances obtained from the environment into the biomolecules needed 
for growth, reproduction, and normal cellular function.  Topics covered in 
this course include the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and 
nucleotides.  Each of these metabolic pathways requires the coordination and 
regulation of multiple enzymatic steps.  The importance of these pathways can 
be appreciated when one considers the processes that depend upon them.  These 
processes include, but are not limited to, the transmission of genetic 
material, cell division, energy production, and the biogenesis and maintenance 
of cellular membranes.
