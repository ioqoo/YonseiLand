UIC Seminar: Topics in Japanese Literature and Culture: “Mishima Yukio (1925-1970): Between Philosophical Rebel and Literary Genius”

MISHIMA Yukio is one of Japan’s foremost modern authors. His public suicide in the aftermath of a failed military coup is a memorable episode that left perhaps as strong an impression on the world literary scene as his oeuvre itself. Beyond the obvious scandal, however, the link between life and work in the public reception of Mishima is exciting from a theoretical point of view. In short, Mishima’s was a life of performance, of perpetual attempt to negotiate ideal and reality, myth and farce, or truth and ideology; and his artistic production a most visible arena thereof. 

In this class, we will read Mishima’s final novels, planned and executed as a tetralogy, which was to showcase the culmination of his literary cum political endeavors of the preceding two decades. Upon its completion, Mishima went on, according to his plan, to commit the aforementioned public ritual suicide. In order to interrogate the literature-politics knot, which organizes and disturbs Mishima’s oeuvre, we will supplement the novels with excerpts of philosophical-essayistic oeuvre of Georges Bataille, a French thinker whom Mishima admired and felt a great affinity for. Come prepared to be scandalized, to feel, to think!
