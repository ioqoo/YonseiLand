The course contains quizzes and two exams. 
Quizzes would be taken almost every week. There will be a midterm exam that covers the first half of the semester and the final exam will cover the second half of the semester. 
This means that the final exam will not be cumulative. Any make-up exam should not be allowed in principle. 
Students will be notified beforehand through the university if the class is cancelled. 
Make-up lectures will also be scheduled and notified to the students within the semester. 
Office hours are held by appointment only. Please come see me before or after class and I will arrange to meet with you at a time that is mutually 
convenient. 
Please feel free to contact the instructor (myself: sjh11@yonsei.ac.kr) or the TA anytime if you have any questions about this course.
I look forward to your progress and excellent performances.
