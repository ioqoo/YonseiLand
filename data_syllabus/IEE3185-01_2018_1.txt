This course is an introduction to the causes and consequences of international conflicts and cooperation in security and economic affairs. It aims to help students learn theoretical tools to understand and analyze historical and contemporary events. Theory is necessary to make sense of international conflicts and cooperation in the past and present, while it hardly is very useful in the absence of knowledge of historical and contemporary events. Therefore, the course explores the wide range of issues including theoretical perspectives in the study of international conflict and cooperation, the causes of wars, the role of international institutions, globalization, nuclear proliferation, humanitarian intervention, and so forth.
