Nation and Gender in Korean Fiction and Film

What does the nation mean for modern Korean women and men? How are notions of gender--femininity, masculinity, and in-between--constructed, mobilized, and managed by the nation? How do power dynamics among gender, sexuality, class, and ethnicity change and/or evolve across different historical and socio-cultural circumstances of the nation? Most of all, what are the roles played by Korean fiction and film as vessels of (imagining) historical and cultural representation--in both national and transnational contexts?

This course explores how the complex relation between gender and nationhood are represented--molded and subverted--in Korean fiction and film. We will first develop a nuanced understanding of the historical transformations that took place in Korea--from colonization to war to military dictatorship to participatory democracy to globalization--with the understanding that fiction and film are cultural products that cannot exist in a vacuum. We will then shift our focus to investigating a wide array of texts--literary and visual--under the umbrella issues of nation, gender, modernity, and postmodernity. 

This course aims for students to: (a) become familiar with the history, fiction, and film of Korea; (b) gain critical perspectives on the representations of gender and nation in Korea; (c) practice and hone literary and visual analysis skills; and (d) present complex ideas in a persuasive and organized manner.
