This course traces the `development` of the English language, examining both 
its internal history (sounds, vocabulary, inflections, and syntax) and its 
external history (political, social and interllectual forces). We will learn 
more about the English Language: how it changes from Old English to Middle 
English, then to Early Modern English, and finally to Present Day 
English. That will also help students understand why this particular lanaguage 
has become the `lingua franca` of today.
