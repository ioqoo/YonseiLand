Course Description:
This course explores the foundations of social cognition. How do 
cognitive processes such as memory, attention, emotion, language, and play a role in social interaction?
embodiment shape the social reproduction of religious and scientific knowledge 
and practices? In turn, how do social, cultural, and even environmental 
contexts influence cognition? Does this complex dynamic between culture and 
cognition change over time and do any long-term patterns emerge from the 
history of religion and science? We will take a hands-on approach to these 
issues through neurophysiological and behavioural labs as well as a field 
trip. 

Learning Objectives:
1. Compare and critique the methodologies and claims of researchers in 
different disciplines studying cognition in science and religion. 
2. Reflect on how these methodologies and claims have changed within 
historical contexts. How have the disciplines studying science and religion 
changed?
3. Acquire basic knowledge in cognitive neuroscience and gain hands-on 
experience in different lab and field techniques.
4. Survey the history of science and religion in different cultures. 
5. Debate and communicate the findings and merits of various research 
approaches.
