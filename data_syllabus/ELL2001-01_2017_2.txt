This class will vigorously examine various elements of writing, theme, essay 
type and structure and relate how students may best use these effectively in 
college-level writing.  This means a move from personal and informal language 
in an essay toward a clear, expository form of writing. We will read and 
examine professionally written essays, students samples and other works. It 
serves as an introduction to academic writing, and will involve reading 
literature, philosophy and criticism. The 
class will deal with issues of drafting, revision, MLA citation style, peer 
review, writing workshops, common strategies for thesis development, topic 
sentence generation and diagnostic evaluations. The work load will consist of 
4 main assignments (2 short, 2 long), and various shorter ones. 
Your papers will be drafted and revised in several stages to elucidate the 
general steps of effective essay writing.

Important Note: Students are required to cite the use of materials written by 
others in all written communications for courses. Remember, the use of ideas, 
words, or phrasing without proper attribution constitutes plagiarism. The 
burden of proof rests on the student, not the instructor; in other words, the 
student will be required to prove that plagiarism has not occurred. 
Inadequately or improperly cited work receives no points and will have to be 
resubmitted upon my discretion.
