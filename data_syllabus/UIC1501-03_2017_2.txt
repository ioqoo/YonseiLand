This course introduces students to the history of the Scottish Enlightenment intellectual culture and its place within world history between c. 1690 and  1830. Through an in-depth examination of Scottish literati advancements in human knowledge or the `Science of Man`, which included the science of women, this course recovers concerted efforts to ‘improve’ the welfare of society in Enlightened Scotland. In Book I of his Treatise on Human Nature 
published in 1739, the Scottish historian and philosopher David Hume suggested that `all the sciences have a relation, greater or less, to human 
nature [and t]here is no question of importance, whose decision is not compriz`d in the science of man`. Hume’s extraordinary claim on the 
interconnectivity of human nature among different branches of knowledge responded to the transitional age in which he lived. With the ‘Science of Man’ in mind, this seminar will consider the various ways in which prominent Scottish Enlightenment thinkers such as Archibald Campbell, Francis 
Hutcheson, Hume, Henry Home, Lord Kames, Thomas Reid, William Robertson, Adam Ferguson, Adam Smith, James Beattie, and Dugald Stewart 
sought to discover the anatomy of the human mind, restore morality in ‘polite’ and commercial society, perfect man as a member of a political body, and 
reform the political economy of empire-building. In doing so, students will explore a range of Enlightenment themes in the study of empiricism,
 toleration, philosophical scepticism, religious fanaticism, justice, constitutional passions, and ethics. A research-based approach to teaching and 
learning will be taken throughout, partly by drawing directly from the course organiser’s personal research, and through the analysis of key canonical works of the Scottish Enlightenment in each seminar.
