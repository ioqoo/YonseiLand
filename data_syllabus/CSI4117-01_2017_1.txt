Data that are accumulating at an incredible rate due to a host of 
technological advances, and electronic data capture has become inexpensive and 
ubiquitous. Data mining is a rapidly growing field that is concerned with 
developing techniques to assist managers to make intelligent use of these 
data. A number of successful applications have been reported in many areas. 
The field of data mining has evolved from the disciplines of statistics and 
artificial intelligence.

This course will examine methods that have emerged from both fields and proven 
to be of value in recognizing patterns and making predictions from an 
applications perspective. We will survey applications and provide an 
opportunity for hands-on experimentation with algorithms for data mining using 
easy-to- use software and cases.
