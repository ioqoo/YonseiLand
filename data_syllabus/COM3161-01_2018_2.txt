This course is NOT about the current state of the music industry; neither is it 
about music management, publishing, or business practices or theories. 
Rather, it explores the history of rock and pop music--its significant performers, 
recordings, performances, and cultural identity--with the focus on the decades 
of the 1970s and 1980s, the two decades that shaped the "visual era" in 
popular music. Ideally, the course serves to develop your general intellectual 
capacities in popular culture. Chronology wise, it picks up where "Rock Music, 
Culture and Society" in Spring 2016 left off.

Also, it`s NOT a music course, per se, but we will be listening to and watching 
a lot of audio/video aids as we consider the effects of popular music on 
contemporary hisotry, culture and society. Thus, this is the quintessential 
"media history" course, as it examines the role of music as a cultural content, 
technological agent, and global product. That`s why it is offered by College of 
Communication, NOT Department of Music.

Reading assignments will introduce the distinct musical styles, performers, and 
works that comprise each genre and a certain time period. They also cover the 
relationship of pop and rock music to American and global popular culture, 
historical representation, and authenticity. While "Rock Music, Culture, and 
Society" emphasizes social and cultural roles of rock music, this particular 
course focuses more on commercial, visual, technological and global aspects, 
which parallel with the social changes of the era (1970s-1980s).
