The atmosphere and ocean control the earth climate system by transporting 
energy, heat, momentum and gas, as well as exchanging them across two 
components. Air-sea Interaction (ATM2106) course examines the influence of 
atmospheric circulation on the ocean, or oceanic circulation on atmosphere, and 
tries to understand the climate system based on the circulation of two bodies 
and their interactions. This course covers the circulation and interactions in 
low/mid/high latitudes and small/large scales.
