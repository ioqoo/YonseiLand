This course explores social movements in modern Japan from the outset of the Meiji Restoration (1868) to the present, focusing on large-scale collective protests against political and corporate institutions over a variety of issues pertaining to communal, national, and international problems. 
Today, as we recently saw from new forms of protest elsewhere in the world, social movements can be shaped by popular media and cultural expressions, and are not dependent upon the involvement of conspicuous leading organizations. In response, commentators of a variety of political positions have sought to assess the (in)significance and (in)effectiveness of the protests. Inspired by these new features and recurring narrative constructions, this course pays specific attention to the cultural aspects of the social movements in modern Japanese history. I have designed this course to: 1) examine narratives of specific social
movements often differently constructed by the participants and historians, and 2) reinterpret specific strategies, messages, and cultural expressions in light of the recent experiences of the social movements.
Specifically, the course examines the ways in which issues and ideologies were expressed through, interacted with, and perhaps occasionally contradicted, various forms of arts, media narratives, and means of network formations. Rather than strictly following the chronology of events, the course underscores themes and problems manifest in specific social movements at certain historical moment. In addition to participation in lectures and discussions, students are
expected to demonstrate skills in effective historical research and cogently argumentative writing as well.
