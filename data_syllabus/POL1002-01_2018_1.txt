This course explores the nature of political life while also illustrating 
various approaches to the study of political science.   With a rich 
comparative perspective, working across domestic politics and international 
arenas, we will investigate how political ideas have evolved throughout 
history and translate into contemporary public debate; how political 
interaction among everyday people and voluntary associations emerges in many 
different contexts, from local community activism to international advocacy 
networks; and how governing institutions within the nation-state and beyond 
shape the course of events.   From established constitutional democracies to 
political systems presently in transition; from formal channels of 
international collaboration such as the European Union and the United Nations 
to grassroots social movements that increasingly use the Internet to mobilize 
across continents, we will compare a broad spectrum of political actors and 
organizations as we evaluate how the meaning of politics is interpreted across
the planet.   The course aims to provide a basis for further study in
political science and international relations; to help you strengthen your
analytical and communication skills; and to inspire you to think and live as
active citizens in an interdependent world.
