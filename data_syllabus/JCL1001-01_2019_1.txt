This course introduces the unique mission of the Justice and Civil Leadership (JCL) major: Explore connections among law, politics, philosophy, and economics, apply these fields (theoretically and pragmatically) to contemporary issues, and produce graduates who use their distinctive focus on justice to tackle social challenges. Law shapes every area of politics, economics, and society. Politics is the study of national and international decision-making. Philosophy grounds us in ethics and justice. Economics determines our survival, social stability, and personal comfort. 

WE INTRODUCE THESE SUBJECTS THROUGH FOUR MODULES: 

(1) LAW: FROM SCALDING COFFEE TO SOCIAL CHANGE
(2) POLITICS: MOST IMPORTANT GAME
(3) PHILOSOPHY: WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?
(4) ECONOMICS: RATIONALITY & BEYOND 

We approach each topic, philosophically and empirically, with explanatory text, original text, lectures, and class discussions. I will introduce topics with a lecture (including PPTs), and then we will discuss some leading literature in the field. Periodically, we will hold student conferences where we will apply class materials to debate topical issues. Students may introduce ‘real-world’ events, so that we may consider practical applications. Students will question assumptions, critique and develop arguments, evaluate normative claims, originate ideas, and become better prepared to confront complex social problems. They will improve analytical, writing, discussion, and presentation skills.  

I MAY REVISE SYLLABUS BEFORE FIRST CLASS DAY. 
I WILL PROVIDE A FINAL SYLLABUS ON FIRST CLASS DAY.

SYLLABUS MODIFICATIONS DURING THE SEMESTER. 
ANY CHANGES ANNOUNCED IN ADVANCE.
