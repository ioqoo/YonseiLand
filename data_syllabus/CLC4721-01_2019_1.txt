The tradition of Humanities has never been estranged from issues found in social, scientific, and aesthetic fields. Rather than focusing on a single subject in Humanities, this course attempts to extensively examine the connection between Humanities and other related fields. Including the already familiar topics like Literature and Law or Literature and Film, we can think about the liaison between Humanities and Music, Painting, Science (Technology), Economics, and Political Thought, etc.
