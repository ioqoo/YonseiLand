This course introduce you to the essentials of research design and data 
analysis. Its objectives are to help you find, pose and frame, and analyze 
questions of interest to you about the real world of social sciences; to 
introduce you to the variety of approaches to empirical research available in 
our discipline today; and try to improve your skill at presenting your ideas 
and plans in a manner convincing to those whose approval is necessary to the 
research planned.
 The course begins with a brief review of the basic contours of the field
and some fundamental problems in social sciences and proceeds to consider the
basic problems of research design step by step.
This course is designed to lay the foundations of good empirical research in 
the social sciences. It does not deal with specific techniques per se, but 
rather with the assumptions and the logic underlying social research. Students 
become acquainted with a variety of approaches to research design, and are 
helped to develop their own research projects and to evaluate the products of 
empirical research.
 Students will work in groups to design and carry out a small research 
project. Group results will be presented orally to the class at various points 
during the semester, with a final presentation which is the fruit of each 
group`s efforts in various stages of research process. A group written report 
is due at the end of the semester.
