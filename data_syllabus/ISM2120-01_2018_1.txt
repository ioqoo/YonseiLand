This course looks at the international human rights regime, discusses the 
origins of the so-called human rights revolution after WWII and looks at 
current human rights problems in the world. It encourages students to 
understand what human rights are and how to practically understand basic human 
rights provisions in the human rights treaties; the work of the UN bodies and 
mechanisms; and advocacy work of NGOs using human rights law and UN bodies. 
Students should be equipped to analyze and discuss various new human rights 
problems and issues that are on the rise with for example foreign investments 
and environmental changes, or non-state armed groups, as well as to look at the 
historical aspects of human rights problems and connect them with recent, but 
not so new issues, such as refugee crises, or crimes against humanity that 
affect us at present times. The students will be offered opportunities to 
understand the limitation of statesâ€™ responses to grave human rights 
violations and the importance of the transnational human rights network to 
place important human rights issues on the agenda of states. Students should be 
able to discuss different views and justify their arguments for or against 
action in the name of human rights.
