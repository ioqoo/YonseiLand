What is the purpose of giving a speech or doing debate? 
The answer is simple: to persuade your audience. 
In this course, we will learn how to persuade the audience by doing: giving a persuasive speech, presenting an analysis of a famous speech, 
and engaging in forensic debate. 
Throughout, we will use Aristotleâ€™s rhetorical tools to frame, define, and analyze persuasion, allowing us to deepen our understanding of persuasion 
while increasing our persuasive skills. 
By the end of Speech, students should be able to:
- apply rhetorical principles to contemporary public speaking contexts. 
- demonstrate an understanding of the rhetorical situation for the speech occasion.
- refine a topic, organize arguments, support positions, and deliver speeches of impact.
- deliver a speech with the audience in mind, eliciting and maintaining audience interest.
