Basic English is an integrated, two-credit course designed to broaden the academic listening, speaking, reading and writing skills of students at the basic levels. The course exposes students to a variety of strategies necessary for successful communication in academic and practical environments. Students will engage interactively in discussions, debates, speeches, and presentations. Students will be encouraged to develop cooperative learning habits by working collaboratively in small groups. Students are also expected to create their own opportunities outside class-hours to further enhance their productive and receptive skills.

This course will primarily focus on students’ productive skills for academic and practical purposes. Students will participate in a variety of prepared and spontaneous oral/aural projects that will help cope with university-level study. They will also be exposed to authentic listening and reading passages to increase receptive skills. Students will listen to and write about topics to practice speaking and writing skills required in academic settings.
