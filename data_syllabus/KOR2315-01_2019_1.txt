Korean language instruction is still grounded in the traditional L2 teaching paradigm where teachers have full control of the curriculum, making it very difficult to provide new contents to a very different demographic. In so doing, the traditional classroom environment has contributed to high anxiety among certain learners and offers very little incentive to enhance interactive learning among students. This is a pilot course designed for exchange students from the University of California Education Abroad Program with limited or no Korean language proficiency. It focuses on “real life challenges” and acculturation, while empowering language learners at the most elementary level using gaming and digital technologies to generate interest.
