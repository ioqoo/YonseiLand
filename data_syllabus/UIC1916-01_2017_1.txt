The course will first offer a theoretical overview of this burgeoning field through 
Douglas Harper’s textbook Visual Sociology and John J. Macionis’s textbook Sociology, 
along with several other readings. The course will require students to utilise their eyes 
and also carry out projects that involve doing actual ethnographic research with subjects 
while utilising cameras. There will be an American-style midterm examination and a 
final project/paper. Students will gain an exposure to recent and current sociological theories, 
as well as a review of traditional theories within the field. This course will be an excellent 
partial review of the basics of the field for majors, while offering a crucial new perspective 
on the field that is often not represented in more traditional approaches to the teaching of Sociology.

“Visual Sociology” (시각사회학). This course is indeed “Visual Sociology” in the
sense that the production of photographic images is the central means of producing 
knowledge about social subjects, all within the context of ethnographic research. 
This course focuses on the new and evolving sub-specialty of sociology that relies on 
or uses visual data to make social analysis. The course considers photographs 
as visual texts that also act as social texts.
