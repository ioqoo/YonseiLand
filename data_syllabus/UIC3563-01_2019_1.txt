This course will be devoted to reading and understanding the first 3/4 or so of Martin Heidegger`s _Being and Time_, which is arguably the cornerstone text of 20th century continental philosophy. We will begin by introducing the book`s project--answering what Heidegger calls the question of being. However, as will quickly become clear, the bulk of the book (which Heidegger never completed) is devoted to arguing for a novel picture of human nature, and using this picture to address themes of fundamental ethical interest.
