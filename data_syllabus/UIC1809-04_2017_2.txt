Classroom policies No electronic gadgets: no cell phones, no iPods, no iPads, 

no computers。If caught, the student final grade will drop by a full letter 

grade (if A & a grave B)。 Language acquisition is a continuous learning 

process that relies on the proficiency gained in the previous semester.  We 

therefore advise that students maintain a letter grade C+ or better, in order 

to advance to the next level.  Without this minimum grade, students are likely 

to perform poorly, if not feel lost altogether, and it is not advisable that 

they advance to the higher level of instruction.
