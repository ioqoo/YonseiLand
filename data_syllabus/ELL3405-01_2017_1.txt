“A poem is something by someone who is not the poet, addressed to someone who 
is not the reader.” -- Paul Valery

This is an immersion course in poetic communicative competence, with emphasis 
on inscriptive and oral interaction, reading, writing, and listening. This is 
a pottery course; our clay is words. Classes will be conducted entirely in the 
language of Poetry. Principal objectives are to take pleasure in and produce 
uncommon verse, to be inspired, to satisfy immediate and long-term poetic 
needs; to increase poetic production, ask and answer questions about personal 
details such as where we live, people we know and no ideas but in things; to 
interact in a sophisticated and simple manner with people who speak and write 
poetry clearly, slowly and quickly and are ready to cooperate; to raise scores 
100-200 points on the IPAT (International Poetry Aptitude Test), and to 
compose long and short written and audiovisual poetic texts. Since the course 
assumes the inseparability of poetry from life, a substantial amount of poems 
will be required. As a good way to learn something is also to teach it, the 
course will include a pedagogical component.
