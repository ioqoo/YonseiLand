The primary purpose of this course is to analyze the formulations and the
solutions of representative problems that arise in the physical sciences and 
are modeled by differential equations. In this course, we begin by studying 
ordinary differential equations and their applications including modeling. 
Next, we study systems of differential equations which occur in various 
applications. We also study Legendre`s equation, Bessel`s equation, and 
Laplace transforms.
