This discussion-oriented course examines the changing relationship between history, memory, and the formation of national identity in post-WWII Asia. With the help of theories of memory and history, we will explore the ways in which Japanese, Chinese, South/North Koreans, and Vietnamese have sought to remember and represent their war, colonialism, and other catastrophic events amidst recent changing domestic politics and international relations. In doing so, we will specifically pay attention to the history, discourse, and space: the history of political contestations in Asia; cultural representations of the past in the forms of artwork, film, and manga; and lingering problems embedded in the sites of commemoration. This course aims to help students better understand: 1) how historical memories are mobilized to formulate the national identities of each Asian country, and 2) how geopolitics and economic conditions evoke differing historical memories of the same historical events.
