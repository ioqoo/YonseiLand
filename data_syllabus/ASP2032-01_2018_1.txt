This course introduces students to the rich history of Hong Kong cinema through the focus of time, space, and identity. Hong Kong cinema participates in the transnational arena of filmmaking from the start?the first Hong Kong film is often attributed to Lai Man-wai’s 1913’s Zhuangzi Tests His Wife. Lai, the “father of Hong Kong cinema,” was himself born in Japan, participated in Sun Yat-sen’s revolutionary activities, and contributed to the flowering of Shanghai cinema in the 1920s. From this brief introduction, the course will trace the emergence of Hong Kong cinema within the contexts of the split of the two Chinas, post-war Hong Kong, the arrival of sound cinema and the studios divergence between Cantonese and Mandarin-language films, Bruce Lee, King Hu, and their heterogeneous martial art films, to the more contemporary films of the Hong Kong New Wave and post-SAR cinema. In addition to providing a historical study of Hong Kong cinema, the course will also focalize on representations of desire and sentiment, postcolonialism, migration, feminism, queer desire, and border-crossing. The class will conclude with discussion on the promise and peril of China-Hong Kong co-production and how Sinophone cinema and new localism might provide new imaginaries to cope with the increasing commercial decline of Hong Kong cinema in the age of the rise of China.
