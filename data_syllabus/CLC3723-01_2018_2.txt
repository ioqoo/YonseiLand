This is a seminar on the political ethos of the West
and its main product: the democratic constitutional state. As a political 
ethos, democracy is based on a 
notion of common good that was developed throughout 
centuries of frequently troubled social and political processes, where trial, 
error and correction/adjustment played - and keeps playing - an important 
part. The seminar intends to highlight this dynamism and its cultural sources. Its aim is to help you a) identify the core values that explain the 
political culture of western democracies; b) apply the resulting 
categories to gain a deeper insight into contemporary events, political 
trends and democracies in other parts of the world, employing - when relevant -
a comparative perspective. Some keywords are: "civil society", "human 
rights", "crisis of democracy", "Confucianism", "democracy as procedure vs 
democracy as a values system", "ideology", "natural law", "political culture"
