Classical economic theory assumes that individuals are rational decision-makers. However, this is often not the case in the real world. Using findings from psychology, behavioral economics have provided evidence that people tend to exhibit different biases due to various issues (e.g. attitudes toward risk and uncertainty; attention and bandwidth; present bias; learning; trust).  
The purpose of this seminar is two-fold. First, the course covers how recent findings of behavioral economics are relevant for understanding development. Second, based on the discussion of the papers, students will explore research questions that incorporate behavioral aspects of development issues, such as education, health, the motivation of public servants, and the provision of public goods.
