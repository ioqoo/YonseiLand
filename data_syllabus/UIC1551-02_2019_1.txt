This course examines the “discovery” and transformation of sexuality in modern Europe.  What norms or expectations governed the way women and men interacted in the pre-modern world, and how did those change with the Enlightenment and industrialization?  Where, when, and how did sexuality become an attribute used to define personhood and identity?  How did issues such as demography, disease, prostitution, contraception, or sexual “perversion” become preoccupations for state and other corporate entities?  The class will explore these and related themes using a broad array of sources.
