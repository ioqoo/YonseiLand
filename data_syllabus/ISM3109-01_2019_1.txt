The objective of Global Finance and Industry is to give you a broad understanding of the framework and evolution of key global industries such as automobile, steel, information technology (smartphone, semiconductor and consumer electronics), consumer, luxury, Internet, airline, oil and renewable energy. The course will focus on industry fundamental drivers (demand, supply, pricing, capacity etc) as well as the major trends and challenges facing key industries. Companies must contend with multiple challenges tied to regulators, legacy systems, disruptive technology, emerging competitors, and ever-demanding customers while pursuing strategies for sustainable growth.

The course will pursue both top-down sector overview and bottom-up individual company research on key industry players with the help of basic financial analytical tools. We will identify and learn the fundamental issues that the worldâ€™s leading companies are facing, which you can use in your post-UIC careers to evaluate future industry directions.

In the first 3-4 weeks of the course, we will focus on developing analytical framework such as industry demand analysis and financial statements analysis. Throughout the course, we will examine many real-life cases such as Apple, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Hyundai Motor, GM, Tesla, POSCO, Starbucks, Nike, Amore-Pacific, Hermes, Google, Facebook and Amazon. Global auto industry and Hyundai Motor in particular will be examined thoroughly to understand industry/company competitive analysis. The Accelerate Hyundai Proposal to Hyundai Motor Board of Directors by an American activist investor Elliott Management will be reviewed.

Industry experts such as equity analyst from a major investment bank and CEO of a gaming company will be invited to the class to share his/her experience.
