Our goal will be to understand the genre of drama which is different from 
poetry and novel.  We will read seven plays written by the twentieth-century 
American playwrights, including Susan Glaspell, Eugene O`Neill, Arthur Miller, 
Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, David Henry Hwang, and Nilo Cruz. 
We will study how each playwright use different dramatic strategy and style 
in order to communicate his or her political message and ideology to the 
audience.  Considerable attention will be given to understanding biographical 
information of each playwright and social context of each play. Through in-
class small group activities, we will practice analysing symbols in the texts 
and meanings of characters` actions and dialogues.
