The course will focus on the literary representation of the psyche of enigmatic characters in British and American nineteenth-century fiction. By analyzing Herman Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener (1853), Henry James’ Daisy Miller (1878), and Thomas Hardy’s Jude the Obscure (1895), and by making reference to classic and contemporary readings in the theory of character, we will link the changes in character representation in mid- and late nineteenth-century fiction to some of the major turning points in Western aesthetics and cultural history.
