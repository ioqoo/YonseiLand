The bildungsroman (coming-of-age novel) has been one of the most important novel genres through which European modernity reflected upon itself and the novel form established itself as the hegemonic form of the modern and contemporary literary system. By focusing on classic examples of the genre, Honore de Balzac’s "Lost Illusions" (1847 - 1843), Gustave Flaubert’s "Sentimental Education" (1869) and James Joyce’s "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" (1916), we will examine three turning points in the history of the European bildungsroman and the literary discourse on modernity.
