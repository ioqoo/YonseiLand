This course focuses on “world literatures” produced within the context of colonialism and decolonization. While much has been written under the rubric of “postcolonialism,” the term remains diffuse and nebulous. The very variety of colonial regimes not only confounds a singular definition but produces a multiplicity of postcolonial experiences. How, then, does “postcolonial literature” engage us in more “worldly” ways of knowing, thinking, writing, and living? How does it call us into uncomfortable conversation so as to exemplify, complicate or refashion the category of “postcolonialism”?

We will read a broad selection of texts from multiple locations--Nigeria, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Jamaica, India, Chile, and Korea--to contemplate how colonialisms have shaped--and continue to shape--the “global” and “transnational” world in which we live today. We will engage with the major issues confronting the field of postcolonial studies: language and identity, nationalism and transnationalism, local and global, hybridity and authenticity, race and representation, gender and sexuality, colonialism, decolonization, and neocolonialism, and resistance and agency.

This course aims for students to: (a) become familiar with key ideas and concepts in postcolonial studies; (b) engage in interdisciplinary approaches to yield multiple perspectives; (c) develop critical reading and writing skills by engaging with a variety of scholarly work; (d) present complex ideas in a persuasive and organized manner; (e) enjoy reading!
