The relegation of past as the past and history as linear development, embrace or critique of the nation-form, privileging the individual or building solidarities, validating strength and perfection or the conscious (conscientious) questioning of its norms ? these are some of the themes we consider in this course. The texts we will discuss are, for the most part, microhistories (studies that focus on a historical figure or text) that prompts us to reconsider what was (is) visible, normative, deemed possible or necessary. While considering an illustration, a writer, an event, we will consider larger questions about history, modernities, Korea, and our own places in the world.
