The world by the beginning of the 20th century became highly interdependent and intervisible in terms of production and consumption, building states and nations, forming new political systems and ideologies. Socio-political and economic development of some countries showed their uneven distribution and, hence, influence on the global scale. Anxieties among the more experienced players of losing the imperial race and the desire of newcomers to join the competition led to the horrific outbreaks of bloody conflicts and wars. Our course “The Two World Wars” tends to identify the underlying mechanisms of the global processes that led to the large-scale conflicts. We will also try to distinguish those ideas and ideologies that determined the subsequent actions of the great powers to spread their influence. The Great War and the Total War (World Wars I and II, respectively), as we believe, were the last global conflicts that allowed us to produce gradual positive changes in international relationships and internal changes toward honoring the civil and human rights of every individual.
