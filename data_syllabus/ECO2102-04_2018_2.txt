Microeconomics is about the decision making of consumers and firms and examines how different market mechanisms operate to allocate resources. We mainly study consumer theory, producer theory, and competitive market analysis.  
This course will emphasize the development of microeconomic models to analyze economic decision-making of agents. It will endow the students with the basic toolkit of microeconomic theory and prepare them to take more advanced courses of economics. 

The grade would not be as generous as before. If a student wants a high grade without much efforts, this course is not the right choice.  I do not want students to waste their mileage for the course applications.
