Students learn statistical models and methods used in general insurance. 
Starting from standard distributions, we will study how various policy 
modifications, such as deductibles and policy limits, can be applied and hence 
the premium can be calculated. Also tail risk measures will be introduced as a 
way to measure the underlying risk that insurers assume.

Models for loss severity: parametric models, effect of policy modifications, 
tail behaviour. Models for loss frequency: (a, b, 0), (a, b, 1), mixed Poisson 
models; compound Poisson models, Aggregate claims models: moments and moment 
generating function: recursion. Classical ruin theory if time permitted.
