1.Give Operation definition of continuum, property at a point, scalar field, 
vector field, streamline, pathline, body force, surface force, normal stress, 
shear stress, Newton’s law of viscosity and calculate shear stress and shear 
force for one-D flow.
2.Use the equations of fluid statics, and be able to calculate the pressure 
differences indicated by various manometers, the resultant force due to fluid 
acting on a plane submerged surface and on a submerged surface with curvature, 
be able to calculate the external force (s) required to maintain the surface 
in equilibrium. 
3.Define internal flow, entrance length, fully developed flow etc. associated 
with internal flow, be able to use Newton’s second law for calculating 
velocity distribution, shear stress distribution, volume rate, wall shear 
stress, pressure gradient in a fully developed flow in a pipe, use Moody 
diagram to determine head losses due to friction
