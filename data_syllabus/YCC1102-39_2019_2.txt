Intermediate level students
The `ideal` student, according to western academic standards, is something 
like this:
- a student who is outgoing and asks questions about the course material
- a student who is proactive with the homework and responsible for their own 
time management (`independently motivated`)
- a student who is not a `sponge` absorbing all that the teacher says, but 
rather a `higher species` who learns from their environment, takes 
responsibility for their own learning, is a self-teacher in a sense.
- shows respect for the subject matter by trying to learn more than is 
required, searches for an area of their own interest to improve their interest 
in the material
