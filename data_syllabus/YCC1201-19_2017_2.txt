This course will enhance studentsâ€™ speaking and listening skills for academic 
purposes. Students will participate in a variety of pre-prepared and 
spontaneous oral/aural projects that will help them consolidate the academic 
speaking and listening skills necessary to cope with university-level study. 
They will also be exposed to longer authentic listening passages for extended 
periods of time. Students will listen to and take notes on live and recorded 
lectures and use course topics to practice speaking skills required in 
academic settings. Through these practices, students will become both 
persuasive speakers and discerning listeners.
