The Roots of Chinese Religion: Daoism, Confucianism, and Weather Control:

the end of this course, students will be familiar with the major developments in mainstream Chinese religion, including the emergence of ancestor veneration, the introduction of official cults centered on the government, the formation of institutional Daoism, and religious forms of “Confucianism.” In this course we explore the history of religion as a window into diverse aspects of culture and society. As one might expect, we will find out much regarding the understandings of human life, death, and the universe that have been held in China and how these evolved over time. More than this, however, focusing on religious activity gives us insight into all other aspects of human life, from politics and economics to gender and class relations.
