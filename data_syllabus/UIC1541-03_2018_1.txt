This course will offer a survey of the central historical developments involved in constituting contemporary scientific inquiry.  As it is intended for a general audience, it does not presume a intricate knowledge of scientific theories, nor is attaining an intricate technical knowledge the purpose of this course.  Though, at times, technical knowledge is covered, such accounts are referenced to the historical framework in which they occur in service of illustrating various larger themes.  In addition to these larger themes we will also consider global pictures about the nature of science put forward by such thinkers as Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn.  To explore how well (and in what ways) these views describe the nature of the scientific endeavor, we will proceed through a loosely chronological examination of a number of major historical developments in science, pausing along the way to consider other central recurring themes in the history of science, such as the interactions between science and religion, science and medicine, science and technology.  Students should come to class and section having read and given some thought to assigned material.  Such preparation will facilitate both a deeper understanding and livelier discussion
