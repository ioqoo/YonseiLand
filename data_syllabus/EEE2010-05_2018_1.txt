This course is designed to 

- provide a range of circuit theory techniques for the analysis of circuits 

containing resistors and independent sources such as the node method, 

superposition and the Thevenin method

- introduce techniques for analysing the step and sinusoidal responses of RL, 

RC and RLC circuits; understand the time behavior of first order and second 

order circuits containing resistors, capacitors and inductors.

- introduce complex impedances to determine the frequency response of circuits.
Having successfully completed the course, you will be able to:

- understand the basic electrical engineering principles and abstractions on 

which the design of EE systems is based. These include (lumped) electric 

circuit models, and operational amplifiers.

- demonstrate in-depth understanding of the circuit theory techniques that are 

available for analysing resistive circuits.

- analyse the step response of simple RL and RC circuits and the sinusoidal 

response of simple RLC circuits.

- formulate and solve differential equations describing the time behavior of 

circuits containing energy storage elements.

- appreciate the practical significance of the systems developed in the course.
