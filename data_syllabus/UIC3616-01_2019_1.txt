STEVENSON, CULTURE AND HISTORY IN VICTORIAN BRITAIN

In 1886, Robert Louis Stevenson, the famous author of Treasure Island (1882), confirmed his reputation as one of the world’s great storytellers with the publication of two further classics, Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Kidnapped. At first glance, the two works appear to be strikingly different, one a gothic horror set in contemporary London, the other a historical adventure set in Scotland in the aftermath of the 1745 Jacobite rising. However, a closer look reveals many common themes, including faith, progress, violence, and the divided self. 

In this class, we will explore these comparisons in the light of Stevenson’s biography and the history of his time. In addition to reading the two novels, we will look at histories of Britain and interpretations of Stevenson’s work. How can fiction inform our understanding of Victorian history? What light does Stevenson’s imagination shed on this period? By taking this class, I hope that students will learn about the interesting relationship between history and fiction as a stimulus to thinking afresh about their own time.
