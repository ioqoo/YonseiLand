This course will provide a high-level introduction to important issues within 
contemporary philosophy of science. These include such fundamental questions 
as: What is science? How does it differ from other domains of enquiry? What 
are the methods by which scientific claims are derived and justified? Does 
science provide a true description of the world? Critically engaging with 
these questions will help you develop several important intellectual skills, 
including the ability to comprehend and analyze difficult ideas, to reason 
responsibly towards formulating your own considered judgments, and to argue 
convincingly for these.
