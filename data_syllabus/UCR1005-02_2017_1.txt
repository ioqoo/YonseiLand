The Zombie Apocalypse is a big theme in Western media. In this class, we use 
the graphic novel "The Walking Dead" as the reading. In the discussion, we look 
at the psychological, ethical, moral, social, and other aspects of the characters 
and plot, as well as the cultural differences of a zombie apocalypse in our home 
countries.
