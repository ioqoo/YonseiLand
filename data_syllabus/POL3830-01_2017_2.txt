This course provides a sweeping overview of the American political tradition.  We will trace the origins of the United States Constitution and the development of the federal government, paying particular attention to the relationships among the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government and the distribution of power among political institutions across the national, state and local levels.  We also will explore broader questions about campaigns and elections, citizen participation and public opinion, as well the roles of political parties, interest groups and the news media.   You will be encouraged to think for yourself about the political development of the United States in a global context and communicate your views in a logical and persuasive manner.
