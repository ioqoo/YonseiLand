TOPICS IN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY: WHAT IS CULTURAL HISTORY?

Cultural history is one of the most exciting sub-disciplines of history but also one of the most difficult to define. What is culture and what is history? How should we relate the two? In searching for answers to these questions, cultural historians have often looked outside the discipline for ideas and methods. In this class, we will try to gain an understanding of what cultural history is through the work of those who have thought about the subject and tried to do it.

In our seminars we will read and discuss important works in cultural history and related fields including sociology, anthropology, art history, and literary studies to understand how the subject has developed. I hope that this class will provide you with an introduction to the relationship between some of the key ideas and debates in modern Western thought. By the end of the semester, I also hope that you will be able to apply the ideas and engage the debates in a reasoning and sensitive way.
