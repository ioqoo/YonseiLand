##
This is a calculus based general physics course covering electrostatics (such as the electric force, the electric field, Gauss’s law, 
electric potential, capacitors and dielectrics), electromotive force, current and circuits, the magnetic field, Ampere’s law, Faraday’s law, inductance, 
electromagnetic oscillations, alternating currents, Maxwell’s equations, electromagnetic waves, geometrical optics, interference and diffraction and an 
introduction to modern physics.
Experiments include L-R-C circuits, Interference/Diffraction and Polarization of light.
Measurements of physical quantities in some of Experiments can be done via computer interfaced data acquisition system. All experimental equipments and apparatus are highly sophisticated.
With a prior notice, the Lab schedule can be changed depending on Lab conditions.
Written laboratory reports including data reduction and error analysis are required and should be submitted within a week after each experiment

A maximum of 100 points for each of 4 exams you can score, for your homework 100 points, for the attendance of the course and the Lab and for the reports in the Lab 100 points.
Your final course grade is based on the sum of all your scores, total 600 points.
During exams any activities of exchanging information with others is not allowed. You cannot use calculators, the notes or other materials 
unless explicitly authorized. 
Anyone suspected of violating these guidelines will be graded ‘F’ in the final grade whatever he/she has achieved before in this course.
Also those who have scores below 40% of total scores, 3 times nonattendance in 
the Lab, over 1/3 absent classes of total classes, a bad attitude toward the course will be graded ‘F’.
