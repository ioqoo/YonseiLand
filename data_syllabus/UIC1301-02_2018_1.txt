Nikolai Gogol (1809-52) and Dead Souls (1842)

Nikolai Gogol is regarded as a foundational figure in modern Russian literature. In addition to his celebrated play The Government Inspector (1836) and novel Dead Souls (1842), Gogol wrote a number of short stories, all renowned for sharp satire, realism with surrealist twists, and humor culminating in laughter--not all for benign enjoyment. The course will offer an introduction not only to the world of Gogol through Dead Souls and select short stories, but also to ways in which literature can be read at a level of complexity beyond oneâ€™s immediate reaction. Students should be ready to read attentively and articulate their ideas actively.
