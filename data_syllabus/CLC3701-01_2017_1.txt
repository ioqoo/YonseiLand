In this course, we will practice the craft of writing for film, television 
and theater. While drafting monologues, dialogues, scenes, scenarios and 
treatments, we will read a variety of plays, TV scripts and film screenplays. 
We will also watch and analyze live and recorded interpretations of these 
texts to learn (1) the art of storytelling on stage and screen; and (2) the 
traditional rules of dramatic construction (and how to break them). As a final 
project, each student will write either a one-act play, TV script on spec OR 
the first act of an original feature-length screenplay. Along the way we will 
perform our work and provide constructive feedback and moral support during 
critique sessions.
