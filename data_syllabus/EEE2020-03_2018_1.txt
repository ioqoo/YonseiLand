This course covers the concepts, uses, and analysis methods of data   
structures and algorithms. Class objectives are:                         
    * Learning data structure types and their uses - arrays, lists,   
      stacks, queues, trees, etc.                                        
    * Learning algorithms and methods to evaluate their efficiency -   
      sorting, searching, etc.                                           
    * Improving C++ programming and debugging skills                     
        - Students will learn data structures and algorithms in C++.  
        - Students may choose any working environments, but class        
          materials will assume Linux by default.
