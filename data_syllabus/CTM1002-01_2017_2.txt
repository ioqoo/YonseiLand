This introductory course aims to provide the undergraduate students at Techno-Art Division, Underwood International College (UIC), with an opportunity to understand computer, computer programming language, and machine learning. I expect our students to understand machine learning algorithms, execute machine learning codes in Python, and apply machine learning programs to other data sets. I also expect our students to know IoT, web, and database.

The role of IT has been increased in accordance with the development of machine learning. Now, many renowned B-schools have lectures involving machine learning. Machine learning is a method used to generate complex models and algorithms for analysts to produce reliable, reproducible decisions and results as well as to uncover hidden insights through learning from patterns in data. In data science, machine learning takes data, processes it via classification/clustering algorithms to help organizations extract insights and make decisions. Machine learning supports human to make better solutions for various problems: fraud detection, prediction of equipment failures, web search results, new pricing models, online recommendation, network intrusion detection, online marketing, pattern and image recognition, credit scoring, email spam filtering, cancer prediction, self-driving car, chess, go, and so on. This IT Foundation course is specialized in data analytics using computer programs implementing machine learning algorithms. 

In this course, students will learn the notion of machine learning including clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical), classification algorithms (e.g., decision tree, k-NN, Na?ve Bayes classifier, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks). Before machine learning, students will learn probability and linear algebra briefly. Linear programming for optimization will be also covered. Additionally, web, database, and IoT will be covered also. Sample codes for the algorithms will be given to the students in Python. Sample data sets for exercising the codes will be also given.
