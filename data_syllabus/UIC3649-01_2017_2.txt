Critical Race Theory and Asia 
This course introduces students to critical race theory and its application to Asia and the transpacific. Drawing from a variety of readings that interrogate our a priori understandings of race, this course will provide the analytical framework necessary to grapple with how race and racial difference are produced and engage with a range of topics that include (neo)colonialism, empire, settler colonialism, and multiculturalism. The course will look at how race and racial identity are culturally, socially, and politically constructed, challenging the biological essentialism often attached to race based discourse and identifications. By learning about the construction of race and difference, students will engage with the diverse local and global histories of the U.S., Asia, and the transpacific that comprise a history of colonialism, empire, and the modern nation state.
