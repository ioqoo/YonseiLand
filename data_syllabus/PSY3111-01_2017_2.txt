This course is a general survey of the field of social psychology. Although a 
broad range of subjects is sampled, the primary focus is on the interaction of 
individuals and their social environment. In specific, the course will survey 
how individuals are influenced by other people regarding how they think, feel, 
and behave. Therefore, the goal of the course would be helping you 
understand how you (as well as others) think, feel, and behave as a function 
of the influences of other people.
