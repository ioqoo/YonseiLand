From candlelight protests in South Korea to women’s rights marches worldwide, from the impending (latent) threat of authoritarianism in the United States to the hard-right swerve 
in Europe, from little Aylan Kurdi’s lifeless body washed ashore on a Turkish beach to dust-covered Omran Daqneesh sitting dazed in Aleppo, from ever-growing inequality to climate change: we stand at the crossroads of global revolt and crisis. Given the current state of so-called “globalization backlash,” understanding globalization seems now more important than ever. 

This course explores how globalization functions as a political, economic, and social paradigm for organizing our contemporary world. Drawing on various theories, discourses, and experiences to better define “globalization,” we will contemplate the historical, economic, social, cultural, and spatial factors that have led to the current conjuncture of crisis and revolt. We will question: How do porous boundaries and multiple identities negotiate the rationales of inclusion and exclusion associated with citizenship? How does global interdependency reconfigure notions of national democracy? How real is the specter of global crises? Are there promises? Ultimately, how can we better respond to globalization? 

Globalization is a complex tapestry and requires an interdisciplinary approach. While the course does not purport to provide a comprehensive survey, we will study a number of seminal texts from the fields of economics and political science, anthropology, sociology, and geography, as well as critical theory to move beyond banal assumptions and generalizations of globalization. We will also examine real-life issues at the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, and technology to further contemplate our role and responsibility as “global citizens.”
