international and global affairs, the course is designed in a way that the students
students get foundational knowledge-i.e., theories and practices-in internat

Both the scope and range of the topics the course will cover are specific as well as
well as diverse. Based on binary understanding of the studies of 
international relations, the course pays its primary focus on international securi

the students to think and write "critically" and "creatively." The students are e

beyond the conventional wisdoms the course will provide.
