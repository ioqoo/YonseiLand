The course is structured totally different from usual classes. The instructor shows in a real time simulation on how a fashion brand can be developed from zero. Quick lectures on crucial topics for the process are combined with tutorial 1:1 teaching. The studio or laboratory style of the course allows to the students to get individual advice from the instructors related to the brand concept they develop. Each student has to elaborate an individual project by the end of the semester. All the tools and helpful considerations will be teached in short lecture sessions and then individually applicated in the single projects. The goal is to find for each project the most appropriate strategy and performance
