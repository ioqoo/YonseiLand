This course counts towards UIC’s scientific literacy requirement. It is essentially an introduction to cognitive science with a special emphasis in the latter half on how cognitive science bears on social issues such as intelligence, race, sex, religion and morality. The first part of the course focuses on models of the structure or architecture of the mind/brain. We will look at different “levels” of characterizing the mind/brain and different contributions made by different fields ?including linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, and psychology? toward characterizing the structure and nature of cognition. In particular, we will examine two competing and central architectural proposals: the mind as a physical symbol system and as a neural network. In the second part of the course, we will examine how contemporary cognitive science contributes to our understanding of sexual psychology, heritability and intelligence, religious cognition, as well as moral beliefs and racial stereotyping. Successful completion of this course will leave the student with an understanding of how cognitive scientists marshal evidence and arguments, from a variety of disciplines, for their preferred explanations of the mind/brain. Students will also leave the course with an understanding of how competing theories pertain to important social issues in the cognitive sciences, and that these areas of research are very active and potentially ground-breaking.

Quizzes: Four quizzes, each worth 5% of your total grade, will be administered throughout the course. Their date will be announced in class, at least one week prior to administration. Quizzes will take place at the beginning of class (be on time!) and consist of multiple-choice questions on readings we have discussed in previous sessions as well as short written questions. You should keep up on the readings and attend class in order to achieve high grades on these quizzes. Questions that pertain to ideas discussed in class but that are not directly mentioned in the readings are very likely to appear on the quizzes. Attendance is a must! NOTE: Some exercises in the first part of the course may take the place of some early quizzes.

Exams: The two exams for this course contain both multiple choice questions and longer essay questions. You cannot expect to simply read the material assigned for the course, not attend lectures regularly, and nevertheless do well on exams. Additional material will be covered during class that is not mentioned in the readings and some material emphasized in the readings will not be emphasized in exams. Attendance is a must!

Attendance, participation, & reading: You are required to attend every class (as far as possible), read the required material, and participate regularly in discussions.

Assessment: You will receive an initial score based on your participation in class, which will then be adjusted as follows: 2 unaccounted for absences = -0.5% (note: 2 lates = 1 absence); not having read the required material = -0.5%.
