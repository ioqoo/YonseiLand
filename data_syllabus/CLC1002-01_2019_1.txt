What is culture? What does it mean to study culture? What are the theories, uses, and methodologies of cultural studies? In this course, we will examine major theories and methods of critical analysis informing the field of Cultural Studies. We will particularly focus on how problems of class, race, gender, sexuality, and empire have been central to the field. Alongside familiarizing ourselves with the work of key critical thinkers of the field, we will bring such insights into conversation with a wide range of cultural texts and practices such as literature, film,and visual art.
