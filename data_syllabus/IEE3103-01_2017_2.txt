This course will provide a borad overview of Korea, mainly focusing on religion, history, and culture. Korea has one of the most diverse and dynamic 
religious cultures in the world. Various religions coexist but no single religious tradition enjoys dominace. Probably due to this, there has been no 
serious conflict and confrontation between different religious orders. However, Korea has witnessed very turbulent history in developing a modern 
nation-state. Starting from the foundation of its nation, this course will deal with how Korea has been developed in East Asia and how it has been influenced by indigenous and foreign religions such as Shamanism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Catholicism (or Western Learning), and Protestantism. 
Lastly, this course will also examine the Korean War, North Korea, and current Korean popular cultures which are dubbed as Hallyu or Korean 
Wave.
