The subtitle of this class is “Survey of World History: Empires, Encounters, and Identities.” This world history class will engage with the linkages between "the West" and "the East" from antiquity to the present-day. Instead of concentrating on the “rise of the nation-state” this course takes the opposite approach by tackling the question of why empires, as a form of government, continued as the dominant form of political organization from antiquity to the twentieth century. Our primary source documents will primarily focus on encounters that individuals had in between empires, which will allow us to understand how individual identity, a sense of belonging or attachment, has changed over time and over space, making the world what it is today.

The course is taught in English, and all materials are in English. I also expect that when you are sitting in my classroom (even before class or discussion has started) that you are speaking English. For me, English is a way for people from multiple ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds to communicate in a shared space without social distinction. Private conversations in a language other than English unintentionally create barriers between students.
