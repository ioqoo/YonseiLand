The ‘Korean way’ of politics has perplexed and intrigued scholars and policy-
makers for a long time. The Republic of Korea(South Korea) has attained a rare 
but exemplary success, as it achieved both spectacular economic growth and 
political liberalization. Yet recently there 
have been an increasing number of intellectual and political debates both 
inside and outside the country on whether the country can cope with the 
consequences of further political and economic “maturation.”  Since South 
Korea has, in recent history, toppled authoritarian military regimes and built 
one of the most affluent economies, this course will also examine the ways 
Koreans themselves think of what democracy means.  As we tack back and forth 
between democratization theories and the Korean experience, we will pursue the 
following topics: civil society vs. authoriatarian state, the rise and fall of 
the minjung ideology, developmental state vs. crony capitalism, women in 
politics, ethinic natinalism and Korea`s response to globalizationvs, anti-
American movement, and the shadow of North Korea in domestic politics.
