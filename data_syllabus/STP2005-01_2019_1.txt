This course deals with human-material relationship in the contemporary era. 
The way we experience things and materials can hardly be considered raw or direct. We do not experience them “directly” as they are in their “natural states.” Nor do we experience them as they exist independently of our acting on them. Things and materials are thickly covered with complex and multiple meanings through institutional, cultural, and political processes. For example, we are living in an age of mass waste, to the extent of exceeding the earth’s ecological carrying capacity. Does the garbage represent the state of “value-zero”? How is this “valuelessness” defined? How this massive inefficiency could be institutionalized by the name of efficiency? Who benefits and who suffers?  
This course will explore themes such as social meanings of materiality and power relations involved in material culture, with special focus on social mechanisms through which materials acquire and lose values. Also, we will discuss how our “built-environment” reflects, crystalizes, and affects those mechanisms. Finally, we will deal with the new kinds of environmental disasters having emerged in the context of fundamental change in human-material relationship due to excessive production/consumption/disposal that was made possible in the fossil fuel economy.
Alongside topical issues such as food, chemicals, technologies, urban infrastructure, trash, fossil fuels, factory and kitchen(places for work), department stores(places for consumption), etc., this course will introduce theoretical concepts developed in social sciences to help understand related issues of exploitation, governance, inequality, and power relation.
