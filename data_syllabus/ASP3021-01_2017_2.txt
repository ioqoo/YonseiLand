While globalization commonly refers to the disjuncture and intensification of connections among people, goods, images, capital, and information technology since the late 20th century onward, transnationalism as a critical framework is often deployed by both the benefactors and critics of global corporate capitalism. Hence, transnationalism gains saliency as a theoretical model across the social science and humanities precisely given its analytical ambition and scalar flexibility. Likewise, sexuality, like transnationalism, is said to be mobile, flexible, and even resistant to structural limits of the nation state. Like global capitalism, sexuality in its hetero, homo, queer, and other variant forms travel through institutions and regimes of capitalism, financialization, visual optics, and bodily commodification. In addition, since the wave of economic and sexual liberalizations in certain parts of Asia, transnational sexuality might be gaining traction not only as an analytical model in queer theory and area studies but increasingly in debates regarding anti-trafficking campaigns, human rights as LGBT rights, and the flows of migrant labors across the transpacific circuits. This advanced level course provides an introduction to psychoanalytic, poststructuralist, and Marxist theories of gender and sexuality in the early parts and then situate these theoretical concerns through methodological query on what constitutes “Asia,” “queerness,” “sexuality,” “gender,” “comparison,” “scale,” and etc. At the end of the course, students can be expected to acquire familiarity with texts from queer cultural expressions in other countries while thinking creatively to expand our received notions of queer theory and cultural politics.
