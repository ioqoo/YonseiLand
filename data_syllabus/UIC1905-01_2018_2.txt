This course will deal with one of the two pillars of the western civilization; the Ancient Near East including  the Biblical(Hebraic) World! However, you will realize by the end of the semester that this ANE civilization and culture are none other than the first human accomplishment, which later on paved 
a way for the rise of Western Civilization. It will seek to introduce the history and literature of the ANE in relation with the Bible to the students; 
Egyptology, Hittitology, Assyriology, and if possible, Minoan civilization in ancient Greek in passing. 
The course will be operative with the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) in mind, as the Biblical narratives (such as creation story, prophecy, and 
historical books) are relatively well known to the intellectuals; the students would be able to compare the Biblical records (narratives, poems, prophecy, and historiography) with the corresponding ANE texts in academic terms by locating them within the world of the ANE.
The goal of the course is to give students a balanced view on the roots of western civilization; Hebraic (in the context of ANE) and Greek worlds.It is 
deemed timely as the world we know it is now struggling to solve potential conflicts between seemingly different civilizations, in particular, 
between Jewish/Christian and Islamic persuasions. The understanding of the common motives and roots of both the eastern and western civilizations
will contribute to a more harmonious development of human history.
Besides the ancient literature, you would be given an opportunity to learn some of the ancient languages necessary for the study, though 
on introductory levels.
You will be exposed to such a few semitic languages and pictorial signs as 
Classical Hebrew, Akkadian(cuneiform), and Hieroglyph (Ancient Egyptian).
