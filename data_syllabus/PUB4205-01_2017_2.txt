This course is designed to provide you with the primary principles that will 
guide you to quantitative policy analysis. We will discuss the forms and tools 
of public policy analyses.  Because formulating and predicting outcomes of 
policies heavily depends on basic principles of microeconomics, we will go 
over introductory microeconomic theory first. The second part of class will 
focus on cost-benefit analysis, which is one of the primary tools for 
analyzing the effect of a government program. In the third part, we will learn 
the basic quantitative analysis techniques which are essential for the cost-
benefit analyses.
