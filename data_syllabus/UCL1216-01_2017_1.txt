This class will consist of different forms of "Non contact Rugby" and mainly focus on Touch Rugby. Touch Rugby is a minimal contact sport that is played worldwide by men, women and children of all ages. Touch rugby evolved from Rugby but has none of the tackling, scrumming, kicking and the like. 
This fast, simple and exciting game promotes the fundamental skills of running, handling, evasion and support play, while developing basis principles 
of attack and defence, without the fear of getting hurt. The goal of this class for students is to learn a new sport, which can be enjoyed for their entire life, in a semester.
