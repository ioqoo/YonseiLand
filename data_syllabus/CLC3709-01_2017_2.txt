In this course we will be discussing three major themes in medieval 
literature: 1) the courtly love tradition from its birth in 12th century in 
Provence through its transformation by the stilnovisti poets and Dante up to 
its secularization by Petrarch as a precursor of Renaissance humanism, 2) 
medieval epic as the genre of the father, and its binary opposition between 
the good and the evil, the group loyalty and the individual interest depicted 
in Chanson de Roland, 3) medieval romance as the genre of sons, and its 
negotiation between the group and the individual. And finally, 4) Don Quixote 
which, taking the chivalric romance as a test case, displays a baroque 
amalgamation of premodern and modern cultures.
