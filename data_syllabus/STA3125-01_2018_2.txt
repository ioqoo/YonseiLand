Regression model is one of the most widely-used  statistical tools in real 
world data analyses. In this class we will explore basic theories for the 
linear regression models - such as simple regression models, multiple 
regression models, model diagnostics and variable selections. If time 
allows, we will briefly cover the real data analysis with the statistical 
package R.
