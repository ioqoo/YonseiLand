This course is an anthropological exploration of food and culture in Asia. We will explore various socio-cultural aspects, as well as the historical contexts, of contemporary cuisine and food consumption in South Korea. Food in different cultures represents more than subsistence patterns. A variety of foods and cuisine are often used as markers for identity, religion, class, gender and regionalism. A distinctive comparative approach will be employed to explore the commonalities, as well as distinctiveness, between food cultures and Asian societies, as represented in South Korea.
