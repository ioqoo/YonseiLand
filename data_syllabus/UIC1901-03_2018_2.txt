One recurring idea in philosophy is that the question "Who am I?" plays a fundamental role in an individual human life. As the philosopher Charles Taylor puts it: human beings are self-interpreting animals. Each of us has a conception of who we are as individuals, and this conception shapes our continual struggle to figure out how to live. For example, the fact that I`m a parent or a child; a Christian, Muslim, or Buddhist; an entrepreneur or an artist is likely, for me, to encapsulate various conceptions I have of how to live my life. If this is correct, then another, ethical question arises: how can I approach the task of integrating my conception of who I am into my life wisely and well? Let`s call the attempt to answer this question the ethics of individual identity.

In this class, we`ll be looking at a particular dimension of the ethics of individual identity: the question how to cope with the *vulnerability* of identity. That is, a common theme among the philosophers we`ll read is the idea that being self-interpreting animals makes us dependent, vulnerable beings in distinctive ways. And so, part of what the ethics of individual identity must address is how to deal with this dependence and vulnerability.

The class will fall into two parts. In the first part (roughly 2/3 of the class), we`ll consider views about these issues from the philosophical tradition known as phenomenology. Here, we`ll read texts from Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Immanuel Levinas alongside commentary and criticism from philosophers like Charles Taylor, Iris Murdoch, Harry Frankfurt, and Hilary Putnam. The second part (roughly 1/3 of the class) will focus on a recent book by the American philosopher Todd May entitled "A Fragile Life: Living with Vulnerability". As we consider May`s book, we`ll also consider some views with which he engages, including texts from recent Anglo-American philosophy, as well as classical texts from the Buddhist and Taoist traditions.
