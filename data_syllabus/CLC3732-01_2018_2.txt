Some films can be a gateway to history, legend, or myth in the past. But films as a fictive reality have their own agenda.
This course will approach medieval culture and society through the lens of films devoted to medieval period, 
but without sacrificing the latter`s autonomy for the former`s authenticity. So we can focus on the distance 
between medieval reality and fictive filmic performances, the roles of medieval male and female characters, 
and each film`s special cinematographic or meta-filmic elements. Students will be encouraged to discuss 
any topics that come to mind in the classroom. For the professor`s side, one of them will be about the reasoning methods 
to solve riddlesome criminal cases appearing in a portion of the given films.
