Name of the Course: Chirality at the Nanoscale 

This course will give UIC students an overview of interdisciplinary field of chiral nanomaterials which successfully combines the chemistry, physics, biology and materials science. Major types of chiral nanostructures (from DNA nanoassemblies to carbon nanotubes and metal nanoparticles) will be presented on primary literature examples. Applications of chiral materials in sensing, medicine and synthesis will be discussed. Molecular models will be used to explain chirality at the nanoscale. Students will prepare posters where they will summarize they chirality literature research.
