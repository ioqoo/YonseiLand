Notes: 
All grading is based on a comparative evaluation of students work in relation 
to other students; thus, no student’s paper can be re-graded on an individual 
basis. As a result, grades will only be changed to correct numerical errors in 
calculation. 

Though attendance is not a separate portion of students assigned grades, the 
university’s attendance policy will be enforced. Students should familiarize 
themselves with this policy.  


Other Policies:
University policies prohibiting plagiarism will be strictly enforced. If 
students are unsure of what counts as plagiarism, they should consult the 
following resource: http://plagiarism.duke.edu.  

Students are expected to be familiar with and to abide by the university’s 
policies prohibiting academic dishonesty.

Students are NOT permitted to video or audio record any portion of lectures. 
Accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities.  
The professor reserves the right to change this syllabus during the course of 
the semester.  Any changes will be announced in class, and students will be 
held responsible for knowing the new information.
