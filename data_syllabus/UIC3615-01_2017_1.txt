Ever wondered who first wrote the Bible? Or in this regard, you might also wish to know how the Bible came into being as we have it right now. 
That is the first topic to be dealt with. The search for the answer requires a sophisticated cooperation from various modern disciplines; sociology, 
archeology, political science, and theology (knowledge and perception of God) as well to name a few. The primary goal of this seminar is to explore
 who wrote the Bible and when it was at first written. Rest assured that this rational question should not necessarily contradict the conventional 
wisdom or belief, rather it would shed more light on it. Associated with the above inquiry, it will also touch upon the concept 
of `Christ (Messiah); it is a corollary topic derived from the research. One of the most popular concepts 
in both Christianity and Judaism, it has yet been properly asked about. 
what it is and why Jesus, the founder of Christianity, had to be called 
by this title, or to be rejected by Judaism.
  The last topic to be addressed is the name of God, Yahweh or Jehovah in the 
Bible. According to the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible), the God of Israel was 
addressed as a personal name YHWH. How did the patron god of a nomadic family 
during the Iron Age eventually come to dominate the rivaling pantheons, giving 
birth to a modern day monotheism? You will be introduced to the first 
appearance of the name YHWH in historical, real texts.
