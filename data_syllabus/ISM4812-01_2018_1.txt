Course Description:

Until the early 2000s, most theorists of justice have tacitly assumed the 
Westphalian sovereign state as the frame of their inquiry. Under the emerging 
social condition of “globality,” however, on many pressing issues of justice 
the appropriate frame does not coincide with the borders of any existing 
polity; nor does the set of stakeholders entitled to consideration coincide 
with any presently constituted citizenry. In such cases, some other frame is 
required. But which? In this course we will consider some alternative 
theoretical strategies for answering this question. Readings include such 
authors as Étienne Balibar, Charles Beitz, Seyla Benhabib, Nancy Feraser, Marth 
Nussbaum, Rainer Forst, Jürgen Habermas, David Held, Thomas Pogge, John Rawls, 
and Amartya Sen.





Course Objectives:



This course will enable students to:

1) Understand the relations between democracy and global justice

2) Critically examine the role of global justice in the 
global issues.

3) Develop  her/his  own  interest  in  a  particular  issue  or  theme  
pertinent  to the legal and political issues that global justice faces by 
conducting a presentation and writing two term papers (5 pages) based 
on individual research.
