In the past few decades technology and science have fundamentally altered our life: from the most private space to the public space; from the way we work to how to communicate (cell phone. internet..etc.) to how to engage wars.  We have come to the realization that these modern technologies have not been without controversy, and many science and technology have sparked intense debates that are often polarized or embroiled in scientific ambiguities or dishonest demagoguery. 
The notion of emerging technology does not necessarily mean that all such advances are new or revolutionary by themselves. These technologies (AI, the digital genome, CRIPR, GMO,Robots,..etc.  ) are now transitioning to a new phase, however, becoming more widely used or incorporated in consumer goods; these technologies are bound to gain more ground in coming years. The emerging technologies of the future will redefine our understanding of biology, the material world and manufacturing. The implications will further extend into geopolitics and global balances of power. 
We must welcome innovation and the benefits it brings us. But we must also remain committed to sustainable development, taking into account issues of inequality, human dignity and inclusiveness.  Embracing coherent ethical guideline is essential for building inclusive knowledge society and raising awareness about the ethical aspects and principles is central for upholding the fundamental values of freedom and equality, solidarity, tolerance and shared responsibility. Therefore, this course aims to articulate how we approach the regulation of emerging technologies will inevitably have wide implications - not only for security and ethics but for our definition of human dignity and the equality of individual.
