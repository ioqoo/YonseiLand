In an occupied society, why do some choose to collaborate, others choose to resist, and still others just try to survive? This seminar will use everyday life in Vichy France as a case study for understanding ordinary peopleâ€™s experience of defeat, collaboration, resistance, and liberation. Readings will consider the fall of France, the exodus, state collaboration, armed and civilian resistance, the challenges of daily life, French and German deportation of Jews, and the postwar purges. Weekly assignments will include sections from one historical monograph or novel, plus several short articles and book chapters, as well as a feature film or documentary. In our discussions, students will also be encouraged to think comparatively, either geographically (to other occupation regimes in Europe or East Asia), or chronologically (to the other world war). Individual students will act as discussion leaders and each will be expected to write weekly response papers and an 8-10 page final essay.

The course is taught in English, and all materials are in English. I also expect that when you are sitting in my classroom (even before class or discussion has started) that you are speaking English. For me, English is a way for people from multiple ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds to communicate in a shared space without social distinction. Private conversations in a language other than English unintentionally create barriers between students.
