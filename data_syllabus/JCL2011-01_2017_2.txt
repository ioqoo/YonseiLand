This is an introductory course in the law of U.S. contract law.  The main objective of this course is to provide the students with a thorough understanding of the goals of contracts.  It will use casebook commentary and case law to support classroom discussion on the subject, while also placing an emphasis on the importance of having a clear idea on what you are asking the court to do, the reasons why you are asking the court to do it, and why what you are asking the court to do is better than doing other things or nothing at all.
