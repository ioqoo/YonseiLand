This course introduces students to philosophical thoughts, with a particular emphasis on philosophical argumentation. We will notaim to survey great thinkers` ideas. Instead, we will choose  a few important philosophical questions, and try to work our way throughthem. 

The topics are drawn from two main areas of philosophy: metaphysics and moral philosophy. The specific questions we will discuss include: 

- What could it mean that I am the same person as an old gray-haired person who will exist in 40 years? Could I survive death?

- What is the nature of free will? How could we be genuinely free if everything in the world is part of causal streams? If we are also subject to laws of nature just like anything else in the world, how could we ever be responsible for what we do?

- Can there be objective standard of right and wrong? What could be the standards, and what do those standards tell us about the issues of famine relief, abortion, war, and so on? 

Along the way, we will learn many basic philosophical concepts and principles too.
