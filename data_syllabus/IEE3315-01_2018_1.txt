This course originated as Law and  Society in fall semester of 2009: how law affects society and vice versa.  The course has developed more towards polemics dealing with conflicts within South Korea. 
As of now, Korea is amid most complex situation surrounding the nuclear development in North Korea posing as an existential threat to not only South Korea but also the U.S. and the rest of the world.  Security for Pyeongchang Olympic was barely assured by South Korea`s efforts towards the participation of North Korea.
With the change of administration comes changes in policies towards North Korea when the world is in crisis over the fast developing nuclear and ICBM missiles of North Korea.
The students will learn legal concepts through current events in Korea at the front lines of a changing society, politics and regional security.
Political consciousness of Korea will be raised through analysis of major events in Korea such as the Cheonan incident, mad cow propaganda, Taean oil spill, politization of sinking of Sewol, militant labor unions, etc.
In the first half of the course, the student is trained to read and interpret codified law as well as common law, and apply them to factual situations.  
The second half of the course will be oriented towards seminars by individual presentations and class participation on determining justice behind various legislations and policies.

speech, homes, work, gender, life and death, and eventually increase our 
radius to include business, trade, refugees, pirates, terror, and nuclear 
proliferation.
By the end of the course, the student will have acquired a legal standard to interpret events around their home country to the global arena.
