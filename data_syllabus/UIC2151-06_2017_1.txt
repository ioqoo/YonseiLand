This course introduces students to the core methodological concepts and 
procedures used in empirical research in the social sciences. The course 
includes both quantitative and qualitative methods. We will cover the basics of 
research design and methods, including research question formulation, 
literature reviews, hypothesis testing, measurement, data collection and data 
analysis. Basic statistics will be covered, including introduction to 
statistical software packages including Excel, but this is 
not primarily a statistics course.
