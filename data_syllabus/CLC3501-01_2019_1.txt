This course explores philosophical and literary texts that have iconic status in Western literature, which grapple with the questions of law, justice, and mercy. While this course may no doubt benefit those who are interested in choosing legal profession as their career, it is open to anyone wishing to reflect on the relationship between the two rival orders of "fiction": the man-made law and the representations of law authored by creative writers. At the heart of this dialogue of literature and law stands the question of (secular and ultimately, divine) "justice," which would be the overriding theme of our investigation. Since the (fictional, philosophical, religious) texts to be met with in this course are great masterpieces in themselves, (re-)reading them under the rubric of "literature and law" should in itself be an ample reward for your choosing this course.
