Course overview: This course aims to inform students of basic knowledge about 
how to conduct communication research, and let them apply to solve 
communication problems in a society. Specifically, three groups of research 
methods will be introduced in the course. First, basics of experimental design. 
Second, basics to conduct and evaluate public or market surveys. Finally, a set of 
qualitative methods (e.g., focus group interview, semi-structured interview, 
discourse analysis, think-aloud method, etc.). Students are expected to attend 
ALL classes; take TWO exams and TWO quizs; and submit ONE short paper. It is 
strongly encouraged to keep developing own ideas after the class, if students 
want (However, it does NOT influence grading).
