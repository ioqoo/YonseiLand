This studio will introduce the basic methods of architectural design and representation that utilizes digital tools and techniques. The focus is on 
qualitative results that are best rendered through digital development, such as tectonic, patterned and layered complexities. The studio will focus 
exclusively on the use of AutoCAD and Rhinoceros 3D which will be used as instruments of design inquiry. Principles of two-and three-dimensional 
geometry will be studied through analytical exercises that incorporate the methodology of digital tools to produce an enhanced visualization of 
architectural form and three-dimensionality.  The course is a design studio composed of lectures, digital workshops and student presentations.

Student Performance Criteria (SPC):
01. Oral and Literal Communication
Abilty to communicate architectural ideas in writng and speech, and the abilty to communicate in a foreign language.

02.Various means of expresion

09. Form and Spatial Organization
Understanding of the basic principles of 2D and 3D forms and design, architectural compositon and abilty to aply these principles to design a 
building.
