The basic and essential work for materials scientists is needless to say to pioneer revolutionary and innovative new materials to develop novel devices. Spintronics (spin+electronics) is regarded as one of emerging nano-technologies that should play an important role in near future. In spintronics, the new paradigm of an additional degree of freedom, spin, of an electron has been introduced which provide with advanced functions not only 
current electronic devices but newly proposed spin-utilizing devices. The spin that has been ignored in current electronics until now can provide digitalized signals in a simple way using states of spin-up and spin-down. Spin valves, non-volatile magnetic random access memory (MRAM) and spin transistors belong to spin devices, for example. In this lecture, we concentrate on studying of magnetics which is prerequisite to study spintronics. We also study in brief the fundamentals and applications of spin devices. The lecture covers; Types of magnetic order. Atomic origins of magnetic moments. Exchange energy and ferromagnetism. Magnetic anisotropy. Domains, domain walls, and their origin. Magnetostriction. Applications of magnetic materials, especially for spintronic devices such as spin field effect transistor (spin FET), memory, logics, oscillators and ultra-sensitive sensors based on the spin injection, control and operation of an electron`s the other nature SPIN. Project related to spintronic devices.
