What is the meaning of suffering in this world?  What is the meaning of man
(woman)?  We search for the truth, yet what is the "truth"?  Why was I put in 
this world?  What was I meant to accomplish, what was I meant to be?  What is 
it that I`m seeking?  What should I be seeking?   What then is happiness?

This course is NOT a study in the history of Christianity.  Historical facts, 
as a consequence, will be held at a minimum, only to give a grounding in 
space and time.  

We live in a fantastic century.  Technology has brought unthinkable 
advancement in our lives.  It has enabled a near borderless world.  People of 
all backgrounds (social, economic, gender, race) can come together in one chat 
room to share and discuss ideas.  As Socrates once said, "I am not an Athenian 
or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."  Given the essential similarity of 
human nature, we must rid our minds of all preconceptions that will dull their 
sensitivity or alertness to fresh insights.  With this in mind, "Christianity" 
will be studied 

There will be focus on how to become a GLOBAL GENERATION CHRISTIAN LEADER.
