PRINCIPLES OF MACROECONOMICS is an introductory course in macroeconomics.
In this course, broadly speaking we will deal with three issues:
Firstly, we will think about the issue of what "wealth" is! To begin with, we will study how a nation`s income is measured. Then, we will discuss the limits/defects of the standard way to identify wealth.
Secondly, we will study the issue of the growth of wealth: how some countries have successfully achieved prosperity, while other countries have failed in achieving economic growth will be our concern to discuss in the class
Thirdly, we will study theories of business cycle, the main topic of macroeconomics since John Maynard Keynes. To begin with, we will think about the very nature of money and the way financial system has been working. Also we will discuss the problem of lack of jobs available in this economy. Then, we wil learn various economic theories from opposing schools that aim to smooth out economic fluctucation
Overall we will think about the better world economy through this course. Keep in mind that story-telling method will be used and your active participation to the class is expected.
