Long before postcolonial theory arose as a field in the late 1970s, Marxian theory and philosophy has provided a framework for the critical analysis of imperialism, colonialism, nationalism, the subaltern, hegemony, mediation and the uneven capitalist world system?as part of its systemic critique of capital and capitalism. Moreover, many of the most trenchant works in postcolonial theory evince intimate engagements with Marxism, such as those by Frantz Fanon, Amilcar Cabral, Stuart Hall, Enrique Dussel, Samir Amin, Arif Dirlik, Gayatri Spivak and the subaltern studies group. This course posits that the analytical approaches and historical studies of postcolonial theory are most effective in examining the complex and contradictory conditions of modern societies, coeval modernities, and peripheral modernisms, as much as their historical origins and colonial/imperial lineages?when combined with a close engagement with the more capacious and rigorous mode of analysis provided by Marxism. 
Towards this end, we will begin with a survey of key concepts in the work of Marx and Engels?alienation, historical and dialectical materialism and Marxâ€™s economic theory?followed by the work of leading Marxian thinkers of the 20th century: Lenin, Luxemburg, Gramsci, Lukacs, and Althusser, Williams, Eagleton, etc. Building upon this foundation, Part II moves on to examine Marxist theories of modernity and aesthetics from the critical theorists of the Frankfurt School, Marshall Berman, the Prolekult movement and Henri Lefebvre. And lastly, Part III examines key issues and contributions towards Marxist postcolonial studies through the work of thinkers who have taken both Marxist and postcolonial theory beyond traditionally circumscribed limits to tackle contemporary forces and structures of contemporary globalization.
