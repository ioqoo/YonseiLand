What is family today? This course proposes to find answers in cinematic representations in East Asia. The turn of the millennium saw the explosive worldwide popularity of Japanese horror, a genre that puts forward the “broken family”?especially the single mother?as the origin of catastrophe. More horrifying perhaps yet simultaneously more realistic is the Korean repertoire of Oedipal nightmares?the best-known being Oldboy, a breakthrough achievement for Korean cinema on the global market. Further diversifying the regional cinematic imagination is the Sinophone cinemas’ subversive experimentalism with the familial institution, from m?nage ? trois to marriage between species. What deadlock of the family do these various figures point to? How do they manage their ways out of it? How are the young generations different from their parents’? How does the aging population affect the family dynamic and redefine the problem of the family? We begin with the supposition that recent East Asian cinemas configure a wide spectrum of familial figures and relations gone awry and at the same time endeavoring to start anew. Students should come ready to engage with the films beyond the familiar and/or facile value judgments and imagine livable futures for the family.

N.B.
*Some of the films contain sexual content, violence, and disturbing affects. Students are advised to survey the film titles before registering for the course.
**Extra class hours will be scheduled to allow time for film screenings, which are mandatory for successful completion of the course. Details will be provided during course orientation.
