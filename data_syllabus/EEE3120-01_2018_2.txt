This course introduces the basic passive microwave components and discusses 
their applications in modern communication circuits. The course introduces 
transmission line theory, impedance matching techniques, microwave circuit 
network analysis, and microwave filter theory. 
The main focus of this course is on the application of microwave 
techniques in the design of real-world circuits and not on the sophisticated 
mathematics needed to solve Maxwell`s equations!
