This course explores the role of the United States in the world from its founding until the present day.  The first half of the course traces United States global policy from the American Revolution to superpower status in the 20th century and looks in detail at the United States role in East Asia and its relationships with China, Japan and the two Koreas.   In March and April, we will have four joint class sessions on these topics with students taking a similar course at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.  Then, in the second half of the semester, we will take a thematic approach in examining numerous key issues and debates regarding the role of the United States in the world.  We also will situate United States global policy in the context of broader theoretical models that seek to explain the field of international relations.   We will examine ongoing events in the news, as developments emerge, and relate current issues and policy choices to lessons learned in the past.
