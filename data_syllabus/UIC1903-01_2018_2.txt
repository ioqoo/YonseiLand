This course offers an overview of the history and aesthetics of non-Western films. It explores how these films have responded to the social, economic, political and cultural transformations in the non-Western worlds such as Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East from the postcolonial era up to the present. Students will have opportunities to understand key non-Western film movements and filmmakers, as well as concepts, issues, and approaches relevant to non-Western cinemas. This course will give students a clear sense of the historical significance of non-Western films overlooked by Euro-American-centric film historiography.
