Advanced College English I is a two-credit course offered to students who need to fulfill their freshman English requirements. IF YOU WANT TO COMFORTABLY AND EASILY FULFULL YOUR FRESHMAN ENGLISH REQUIREMENTS YOU SHOULD TAKE A DIFFERENT CLASS  -- this class requires a lot of work.
Over the semester we will work on listening and speaking skills. Students will be required to participate fully in class and are expected to do a lot of 
homework outside of class with, in particular, the weekly listening homework. Be prepared to spend a lot of time each week on homework.
