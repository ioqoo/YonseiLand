The objective of this course is to present a number of power system concepts, which appear in most power system analysis problems. That is, the power network analysis techniques such as power system dynamic modeling, power flow computation, and economic dispatch are studied. Also, the stability issues for the power system control operation are studied based on basic control theory.
