We begin by examining how time and space were re-conceptualized starting in the 19th century. We look closely at the historical context, to understand how and why intellectuals across East Asia came to embrace different aspects of European history and modernity as “universal.” What ideas and technologies enabled the construction of the nation form (民族)? In the second part of the course, we examine the cultural pasts and contemporary identities that colonialism helped establish. We end by reflecting on revolutions of the 20th century, the end of revolution, and life choices that students face today. Overall, the aim of the course is to introduce students to critical scholarship in Asian Studies that shed light on the relationship between power and knowledge ? how power/knowledge shape how and what we see, and the way we inhabit the world.
