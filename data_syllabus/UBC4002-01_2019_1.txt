This course targets students who are interested in advanced level chemistry and biology courses. 

Chemical biology is a scientific discipline spanning the fields of chemistry, biology, and physics. It involves the application of chemical techniques, tools, and analyses, and often compounds produced through synthetic chemistry, to the study and manipulation of biological systems. Chemical biologists attempt to use chemical principles to modulate systems to either investigate the underlying biology or create new function. 

Two-hour in-class lectures on every Tuesday & one-hour on-line lectures on every Thursday.
