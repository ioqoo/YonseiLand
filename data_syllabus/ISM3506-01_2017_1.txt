More than ever in modern history, we are living with constant and grave threat of terrorism.  That also makes it clear that it is hard to imagine a more exciting and crucial time to be studying international security. 
Fifty years in the future, people will justifiably label the current era as one of the most important transition points in modern history. The transition is also fraught with uncertainty. Some observers long for the days of stability found  during the Cold War prior to the arrival of global terrorism; others view the current situation as an unparalleled opportunity for advancing the interests of all people despite the new threat. In many ways, both groups are correct. Any period of profound change creates opportunities for both progress and disaster. But which outcome is more likely? More importantly, how can we decide which policies will help us make progress while avoiding disaster? In this course we will address a number of important questions or puzzles which will determine the balance between progress and disaster.  
The purpose of  this course is to provide you with the tools necessary to answer these important questions. First, the course will introduce to you a wide range of general theories on terrorism. Second, the course will identify methods, policies and theories that are useful for determining national and international security.  Third, the course will expose students to a wide variety of problems confronting the international community.
