Course Description:
Until 1980s, political theorists had a tendency to ignore or avoid 
international issues and focus on domestic political contexts. Since the end of 
twentieth century, however, the term “globalization” has been an all-purpose 
catchword not only in public opinion but also in scholarly debate. Today, it is 
impossible to understand world affairs without grasping the contemporary 
phenomenon of globalization.
But, what is globalization? What are its main issues? This course aims to help 
students to conceptualize globalization and its diverse dimensions such as 
political, economic, cultural, and ideological. Based on this understanding, 
students will investigate the following questions: how are goods, capital and 
people moving around the world in new ways?; how do these radical movements 
change politics locally and globally?; how do they relate to national security 
and national sovereignty?; how do we share the benefits of globalization?; Are 
there duties of global justice?; Does global justice require the development of 
global democratic institutions or a world state?; When and how is coercion or 
the use of force in world politics ever justified?  
While exploring these questions, students will learn to understand 
globalization as a complex phenomenon involving constant change in need of 
being reframed.
Course Objectives: 
This course will enable students to: 
1) Understand different dimensions of contemporary globalization. 
2) Critically examine current political, economic, and cultural events and 
issues of globalization in newspapers, films, and other media. 
3) Develop  her/his  own  interest  in  a  particular  issue  or  theme  
pertinent  to globalization by conducting a group presentation and writing two 
term papers based on individual research.
