This course provides fundamentals of solid state physics essential to 
understand the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of materials. In 
particular, it focuses interactions and behaviors of electrons in the solid 
because they are mostly responsible such characteristics. Reciprocal spaces to 
understand electron waves, duality of electrons, classical and modern electron 
theories, origin and properties of energy bands in solids, with applications 
to electronic transport in applied electric and magnetic fields and to optical 
properties are covered. Basics of magnetism are also surveyed.
