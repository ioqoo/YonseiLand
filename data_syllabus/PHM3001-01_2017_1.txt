This course provides a comprehensive account of advanced organic chemistry for 
pharmacy undergraduate courses. As a course of advanced organic chemistry, the 
approach, based on mechanism and reaction type, aims at understanding rather 
than factual knowledge, enabling the student to understand reactions not 
previously encountered. Furthermore, many case studies to prepare commercial 
medicine synthetically are introduced.
