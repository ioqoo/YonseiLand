This course provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of sustainable development and requirements for the Major.  Students will learn about the interactions between physical ecology and economic development, and gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which they impact each other. Ecological constraints (climate, disease ecology, physical resources such as soils and energy sources, topography and transport conditions) significantly shape the patterns of economic development, demography, and wealth and poverty. At the same time, anthropogenic activities (farming, resource depletion, demographic stresses, and energy use) change the physical environment. 

Weekly discussions will explore the breadth of the major and the multidisciplinary nature of the scholarship to provide students with an understanding of economic development and its relation to nature`s processes. Guest speakers will share information about possible courses to take in the future and opportunities upon graduation.
