The goal of this class is to introduce students to the fun and illuminating activity of literary analysis. We will learn to pay attention to the formal elements of literary texts and explore the philosophical and political questions raised by literary representation.

Over the course of the semester, we will read four modern and contemporary novels written in English. We will encounter a variety of analytical frameworks through which to approach these texts, including feminist, postcolonial, and deconstructive perspectives. Finally, we will formulate research questions about literary texts and learn methods of finding and evaluating relevant scholarly sources.

Our reading schedule is structured around two pairings, each of which brings together a canonical modernist novel from the early 20th century and a more contemporary novel. In the first half of the semester, we will read Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad’s novella about European colonialism in the Congo, and Disgrace, J. M. Coetzee’s portrayal of life in newly post-apartheid South Africa. Both narratives depict a crisis and formation of white masculine subjectivity in ways that raise challenging questions about gender and race relations. In the second half of the semester, we consider a female version of this kind of narrative?a narrative of subject formation or moral education known as a Bildungsroman? in Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse and Chemistry by the Chinese-American writer Weike Wang.
