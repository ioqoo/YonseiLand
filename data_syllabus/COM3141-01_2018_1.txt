As media and art histories testify, technological and aesthetic characteristics of media and art have reflected, informed, challenged, or transformed our way of thinking and living, including a vision of the world we live in--or we hope to live in.  This course aims to examine some of the scope and ramifications of media and art practices in modern society.  Part 1 will be organized around various, eclectic themes/media forms.  By exploring some theoretical accounts on “old,” un/usual media/art (e.g., writing, photography, film, radio, and the train), we can identify the recurring questions and apply them in a more contemporary setting.  Part II will further deepen the understanding of media, art, and society by introducing you to some current topics central to political and ethical discourses surrounding the practices of (not) looking, seeing, watching, or witnessing.  You will be expected to engage in serious reading, reflection, discussion, and writing on several topics that are guaranteed to be an important part of our mediated public life.
