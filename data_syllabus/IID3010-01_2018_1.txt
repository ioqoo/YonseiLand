The senior project is a student-selected exploration of a theme during a semester that results in a project outcome and a documentation of the process, and all the works will be displayed in the IID graduation exhibition in the fall. The goal of this course is to integrate theory and application from the studentâ€™s undergraduate education experiences. 

In this course, students will be able to:
- Reduce a theme to specific points of analysis
- Organize the points of analysis into a logical sequence
- Conduct exploratory, generative and evaluative research, throughout the design process
- Integrate rigorous design process and design research
- Estimate and manage hours of labor and/or cost of resources necessary to complete a project
- Create design artifacts that demonstrate your understanding of a theme in depth
- Organize, illustrate, and write clear and concise project documentation
