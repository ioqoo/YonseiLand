Macroeconomics is a branch of economics dealing with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of the whole economy that includes a national, regional, or global economy (Macroeconomics, Wikipedia). Specifically, in this course, we will study two subfields of macroeconomics, the Economic Growth and the Economic Fluctuations. In the first part of the course, we will analyze factors that determine the long-run economic growth of output or the standard of living. The second part of the course will be devoted to the short- and medium-run economic fluctuations. We will understand how important macroeconomic variables such as output, prices, unemployment, and interest rates, are determined. In addition, we will consider the role and effects of various macroeconomic policies. Finally, we are going to review the recent global recession: its causes, effects and policy responses.
