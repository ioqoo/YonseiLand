This course is designed as a forum in which you can reflect deeply and extensively on reasoning--and in particular, on what differentiates good reasoning from bad reasoning.  We`ll follow two approaches in the course, looking first at some accounts of good reasoning that have been proposed by logicians and then turning to examine some philosophical questions about the nature of good reasoning.  Over the course of the semester, you`ll have opportunities to consider:

(i) Some foundational logical concepts and techniques pertaining to the nature of arguments, the distinction between good and bad arguments, and logical fallacies;

(ii) Psychological and philosophical findings regarding the effects of implicit bias on our reasoning and thought; 

(iii) Whether we are obligated to always have evidence for our beliefs, or whether it can be acceptable to have faith; and

(iv) Philosophical issues pertaining to the ways in which we do--and ought to--reason about morality.

Insofar as the course tackles both theoretical and applied topics, my hope is that it will prove useful to students with diverse academic backgrounds and interests.  By the end of the course, you should acquire a better appreciation of how to reason well and how, in particular, to reason well when making moral decisions.
