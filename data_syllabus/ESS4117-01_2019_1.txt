The purpose of this course is to introduce students to one of the most recent, 
actively evolving research fronts of earth science and biosciences, i.e., the 
interdisciplinary field of geomicrobiology.  The course will focus on mutual 
interactions between microbial and geological processes.  Topics include: role 
of microorganisms on mineral weathering rates, microbial mediated ore deposit 
formation, microbe enhanced oil recovery, life in extreme environments, search 
for bio-signatures in geological records and meteorites and implications for 
life on Mars, microbial ecology in ocean floor hydrothermal vents, etc.
