The course aims to understand diverse actors that contribute to sustainable development, including pro-poor economic growth, poverty alleviation, and livelihoods improvement. Students will learn about the logic and rationale of those actors, such as the United Nations Programs, Funds, and Specialized Agencies, multilateral institutions and bilateral agencies. As students explore specific case studies of each actor, they will have a chance to apply their knowledge of sustainable development to conduct critical evaluation of policy, agenda, and/or programs that are funded by these actors. 

This class is designated as a Social Innovation Certificate (SIC) course. The course contents and practices will be related to social innovation and social problem solving. 
Also, the Institute of Higher Education Innovation (HEI) may collect and accumulate student assignments and course contents for further purpose.
