We humans are social creatures and our brains are wired to connect with other people. 
In this course, we will discuss how social humans are both in terms of behavior and brain. We have two main goals. The primary goal is to 
understand the fundamentals of human behavior in social context. We will cover some selected topics in social psychology. The secondary goal 
is to explore the neural basis of social behavior. We will review social neuroscience research findings that correspond to topics covered in class. 
This second goal seeks to promote our knowledge of how human brains respond to the social world. 
 
This course is designed to parallel social psychology. Both cover the topics of how people think, feel, and behave in social situation. However, 
there is an important difference. In comparison with typical social psychology course, students will have more opportunities to explore the neural 
mechanisms of the social mind. We will focus on recognizing implications of neural correlates of social behavior. There will be less emphasis on 
physiology and anatomy of the nervous system. Thus, this course is not intended for those with strong academic interests on brain anatomy, 
biological mechanisms, and structural/functional aspects of the nervous system.
