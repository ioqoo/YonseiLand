The Relations between nationalism and social movements have not been studied much, though both are social phenomena that are based on collective identities, which are the bases of politics of modern time.  Especially when we try to understand the international relations or political history of countries in East Asia, we often understand nationalisms in the region only as the roots of the conservative or even totalitarian political ideologies that reproduce the conservativism and deepen the conflicts between the countries in the region. This perspective is also related to the old prejudice of nationalism studies that regards non-Western nationalism as ethnic and dangerous. 
 This course aims to investigate the basic relations between nationalism and social movements in East Asia. First, this course investigates the changes in theories of social movements and explore how social movements and collective identities are connected. Second, understanding nationalism as ongoing process with the incessant competition between the groups in the society, this course reads the social movements in East Asia as attempts of creating collective identities countering robust official nationalist narratives. Given the strong nationalism as the condition of nation-building process of the countries in the region, this course will study how various counter narratives of nationalism emerge and the different intentions of creating collective identities from the groups that compete with the idea of favorable nation and state in the public sphere through specific cases of social movements based on nationalism.
