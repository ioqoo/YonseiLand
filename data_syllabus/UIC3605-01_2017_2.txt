We are all consumers: we consume food, fuel, raw materials; art and popular culture; and even education. And we also 
consume time, energy, space... and, as a whole, the human race is consuming the resources of the planet at an unprecedented and unsustainable 
rate. Even though economists and political theorists often believe that "production" is the most fundamental human activity, it is becoming increasing
clear that it is not first of all as producers, but as consumers, that we exist on this earth. Yet: consumption remains an obscure and little understood
concept.
The aim of this class is to explore the history of the concept of consumption, and work toward a better understanding of what it means to exist as
 consumers.
We will read key texts from the history of philosophy, key works of continental philosophy, as well as more contemporary texts.
