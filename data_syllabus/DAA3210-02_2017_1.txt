##
Physical Chemistry I deal with equilibria in chemistry, including physical 
change such as fusion and vaporization, chemical change, and electrochemistry. 
Particularly, thermodynamics inlcuding concepts of enthalpy and entropy will 
be studied to obtain a unified view of equilibrium and the direction of 
spontaneous change in terms of the chemical potential of substances.
