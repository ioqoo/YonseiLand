The history of Christian theology began with the Christian apologetics. Theology has developed and been modified in such a way that it reflects the existentiell reality of believers. That is, Christian theology has not been immutable, unchangeable, and absolute truth, but rather a `reflection` which actively has communicated with the spirit of each age. Christian theology has been in its inner essence, as it were, anthropology. This is the reason why we should read theology in light of philosophy. Philosophy is a systematic interpretation of human self and the world, which constitute human existence.

This course primarily aims at an investigation of the relationship between theology and a few major streams of philosophy which provided fundamental structural frameworks for theology. The interaction of four prominent philosophical streams (Platonism in the ancient world, Aristotelianism in the late medieval world, Kantianism in the age of Enlightenment, and Existential Philosophy of Kierkegaard and Heidegger in the contemporary world) and theology will be examined in a brief but prudent manner.
