Syllabus_Korean
##
What does it mean for a Korean to write in English? Is the self portrayed in 
English different from the self portrayed in Korean? If so, what kind of 
possibilities does this hold especially for womenâ€™s voices? In this course, 
by engaging with the genre of autobiography and biography written by women, we 
will explore the constructed nature of the personal - the rules and 
conventions of the genre - in order to experience the discursive work of self-
making in writing our own autobiography and biography.
