This course is designed to discuss the complex nature of East Asian international order. There is an increased level of economic interdependence across the national economies in East Asia. Such interdependence shapes and constrains their foreign policies. But the ongoing power shift best characterized by a rising China and relatively declining the United States and Japan, is destabilizing the regional security system, often negatively affecting economic cooperation. Besides changes in material structure, East Asia is embedded in ideational structures that present clashes of national identity on the one hand and emerging collective identities on the other. The contested interpretation of the past concerning traditional Chinese empire and modern Japanese colonialism have helped to create identity conflict, but at the same time counter-veiling forces have delimited the range of tension among actors. 
 
This course aims to understand the nature of East Asian international relations that blend and conflate the above three layers of regional characteristics, entering into the security-economic-identity nexus. Key theories and debates in the field of IR and IPE will be employed to examine the political, economic, and cultural contexts in which the region has evolved through the dynamics of division and integration. The first part will cover historical evolution of the regional order including a traditional hierarchical order centered on China, a modern imperialist and colonial order centered on Japan, and a postwar Cold-War order shaped by the United States. The second part will discuss contemporary regional foreign policy issues ranging from great power rivalry, economic interdependence, history conflicts, and nuclear problems.
