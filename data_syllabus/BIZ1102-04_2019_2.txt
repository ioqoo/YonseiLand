In this course students explore the systematic interrelation of variables (psychological variables, in particular) that are useful in observing and predicting organizational behavior. Students develop analytical and critical thinking about organizational problems to increase their effectiveness as employees and managers ultimately. Specifically, we will study factors that influence individual job performance and potentially team and organizational performance, such as attitudes, motivation, personality, emotion, leadership, power/politics, and culture. Lectures, class discussions, readings, activities, assignments and exams are all intended to facilitate your understanding of these issues and ultimately your ability to apply key principles in organizations.
