Today there is an urgent need for radical changes in our production and 
consumption patterns so as to delink economic growth and environmental 
pressure and avoid catastrophic consequences. Given the capabilities of 
designers to imagine and create, the following question is raised: what can 
designers do for a more sustainable future? In this introductory course to 
design for sustainability (DfS), we critically examine the unsustainable 
culture of contemporary society, and explore the roles of design for more 
sustainable ones. 

The course offers a systemic overview of the environmental and social 
challenges that we face today, a series of dialog on our unsustainable culture 
and behaviour, ongoing efforts to change them particularly through design 
interventions, and a hands-on experience to design products, services, and 
systems that influence and shape sustainable production and consumption.

Sustainability is a transversal theme that goes across design domains. 
Students who have acquired basic knowledge about design for sustainability in 
this course would be able to apply it to various courses and projects. Most of 
all, it is anticipated that students will have an aptitude to practice design 
that cares for people and the planet.

From this class, students will be able to:
• Understand the notion of social and environmental sustainability 
• Explore design practices for or against sustainability
• Experiment with design for sustainability
