This seminar course investigates the Johannine concept of truth in its Jewish and Roman imperial contexts in hopes of reconsidering it in the contemporary world lacking in certainty. To do so, the course will have three main stages. To begin with, the course will explore the ancient Greek, Roman, and Jewish world as a backdrop against the Johannine world. Second, the course will give an overview of the Gospel of John. Third, the course will take a closer look at selected passages from the Gospel with Jewish and Greco-Roman contexts in mind. 

Students will learn rudimentary skills with the purpose of critically reading and interpreting the Gospel. To this end, students will learn to: (1) detect the different perspectives residing in different world views, Jewish or Greco-Roman; (2) practice biblical interpretation in the historical, literary, sociocultural, and theological contexts; (3) critically, but respectfully, listen to diverse voices of other readers with a view to honing their own interpreting skills.
