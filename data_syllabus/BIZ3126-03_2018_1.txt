Throughout this course, we will focus on the understanding of consumer behavior, how and why consumers make purchase decisions, how they think, feel and act before, during and after the purchase. Also we will examine important concepts underlying consumer behavior and apply principles, and theories from the various social sciences to marketing problems such as product development, pricing, and positioning.
 Overall, understanding consumers enables marketers to more effectively meet the needs of buyers in the market, and be more successful in the market. The overall goal of understanding consumer behavior (and this course) is to prepare tomorrowâ€™s marketers to create and market brands that successfully meet consumer needs. More specifically...

- To understand the importance of consumer behavior in the overall marketing process.
- To understand how and why consumers behave - in general - and by segments.
- To gain a working understanding of the tools used to uncover their behaviors.
- To learn how to apply this knowledge (ethically) to create product, service and marketing ideas in ways that motivate consumers to act.
- Once the above objectives are achieved, each student will also be able to think like a marketer, and in so doing, be a better consumer as well.
