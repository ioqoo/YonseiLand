We use camera everyday. However, do we really know how to use it to express our thoughts? Using cameras and cell phones, we document  joy of  friendship, closeness of our family, and precious moment of time gone by. Using our sensibility, a camera can become a powerful paint brush to record beyond  these snapshoot moments.  Each week through various assignments, students will learn to harness your inner thoughts. Also 2nd half of the semester we will learn to dramatically improve your images through Photoshop.  This course contains components of picture making, lighting, and 
composition. Through slide lectures, critiques, and readings, we will develop a vocabulary for critical discourse and discuss historical and contemporary concerns in photographic practice.
