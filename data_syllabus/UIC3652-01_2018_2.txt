One of the most popular genres of life writing in the twenty-first century has been the memoir. But the art?or act?of telling one’s story is a genre with a long history. This semester we will briefly study the history of life writing and explore the various forms of the genre, including the memoir, fiction, and poetry. You will have a chance to experiment with these genres and test the formal boundaries of life writing. The course will focus on writing as a way of discovering the self, mining the past and present, and examining?as well as recreating?one’s own life through nonfiction and fiction devices.
