Course Description:
From apocalyptic prophecies heralding the death of the book to accolades celebrating digital media, the rapid innovations in the ways we read and write are being fiercely debated. This course will look at the techniques, practices and technologies of two of the most fundamental communicative operations and their representations in literary texts. Paper will be our first topic. Even in our “digital age,” there is more paperwork now than ever before, used for storage, for recording and for bureaucratic purposes from legal documents, immigration records, filing systems and packaging. We will then isolate a number of writing practices with which we are familiar, tuning in to their media technologies and histories ? notetaking, letter writing, typing, or “light writing” (photography). 
In the second half of the course, we will focus on the transformations of the technologies and formats of reading. Again, our focus will be on practice. We will discuss ordering, collecting, and experimentation with books and new forms of reading in our current media ecology (texting, tweeting, listening, distant reading). Throughout the course, we will continually reference discussion from previous class sessions when approaching newer material and practices (note-taking and letter-writing key to the section on books and book-making for example).
We will discuss how media theoretical approaches may be used to study literature, and how literature may help us make sense of and process contemporary transformations in communication.  The course will have a maximum of 60-70 pages of reading a week.
Course Goals:
Engage with a variety of methods available to comparative literature, cultural theory, and media studies for analyzing literature and reflect on the many ways of reading them beyond traditional close reading or narratology.
