One interesting phenomenon at the turn of the twenty-first century has been the global popularity of “rule of law” as an ideal to aspire for. For many 
countries coming out from under communist or authoritarian rule with state-centered economic regimes, the rule of law was seen as the key to their successful transition to a more democratic and market friendly systems. For their part, the more advanced countries of the world and international organization, as well as many private institutions, sponsored and organized numerous rule-of-law assistance programs to promote the ideal worldwide. 
Almost twenty years later, there are differences of opinion as to whether rule of law has actually spread to more countries of the world. What is undisputed, however, is that the term has gained a status as an unquestioned legitimizing principle. Like “democracy,” it is now a badge of honor which every country wants to claim for itself in order to be considered a member of the community of civilized nations. Even very oppressive dictatorial regimes claim, at least in their official rhetoric, that they are committed to the rule of law. 
This course will be an investigation into various aspects of this phenomenon 
called the rule of law. Recognizing that the idea has been around for 
centuries, we will start with an inquiry into the various ways in which people 
have understood the term. What does it mean to be under the rule of law? Where 
did the idea originate from? We will then turn to the more recent career of the 
ideal. Why has rule of law become such a popular goal worldwide? Who promotes 
the rule of law, and for what reasons? Are there any downsides to the ideal of 
rule of law? Can it--indeed, should it--be implemented in any country? What are, 
if any, the sources of threat to the ideal of rule of law?
