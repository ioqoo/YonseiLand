Transport of momentum, energy and mass is essential for living organisms to 
sustain their lives. Investigating how the living organisms accomplish 
sophisticated ways of biological transport requires good understanding of 
transport phenomena including fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and mass 
transfer. Moreover, concepts and principles to be delivered in the course are 
prerequisites for bioengineers to design and operate downstream bioprocesses. 
This course is intended to provide students with fundamental principles in 
transport phenomena and relevant topics in biological systems.
