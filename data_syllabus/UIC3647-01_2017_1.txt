This course aims to elucidate two fundamental problems constitutive of, and constituted by, psychoanalysis: hysteria and the Oedipus complex. Sigmund Freud inaugurated the multidisciplinary theory and clinical method as a study of hysteria, which went on to produce some of the most convincing, striking, and productive discoveries in the dynamic of the bourgeois nuclear family. Although only one part of what turned out to be an extensive theoretical system, the hysteric’s place in the Oedipal family has become a powerful metaphor for psychoanalysis tout court and as such continued to exert great influence on humanistic discourse. Overall, we will deal with roughly the first half of Freud’s career in psychoanalysis, from 1895 when Freud and Josef Breuer’s Studies on Hysteria appeared, signaling the proper beginning of psychoanalysis, to 1914, the year sometimes considered the turning point in Freud’s thinking. Students should come ready to engage with complex ideas and look beyond (or, reexamine) what is visible, obvious, and familiar.
