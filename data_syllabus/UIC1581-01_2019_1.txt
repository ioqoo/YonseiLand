This course surveys Asian civilisation from the Neolithic period to the twenty-first century. It traces major shifts and developments in human history through a series of lectures focussing on East Asian, South Asian, Central Asian and Near Eastern civilizations. The reading materials will introduce students to some of the most significant and influential contemporary scholarship and primary-source material in Asian and human history. Some of the themes that will be explored in this course include empire, colonialism, 
religious conversion, and nationalism. This is a compulsory subject designed for first year students.
Students who complete this course will be able to demonstrate a comprehension of the major events, themes and movements in Asian history. Their acquired knowledge of 
Asian civilizations will allow them to pursue more complex studies into the history, philosophy, and culture of Asia. They will also be able to demonstrate an understanding of the major regions, civilizations and periodizations of Asian history and how these processes helped to shape modern Asia. 
This course will take a thematic approach to the study of Eastern Civilizations. Each Wednesday, students will be introduced to a new keyword or theme which will be explored in more detail on the following Monday with reference to a particular civilization in Asian history. Some of the keywords that will be covered in this course include 
‘civilization’, ‘empire’, ‘nationalism’, and ‘modernity’. Students are expected to read set passages every week in preparation for the Monday lectures.
