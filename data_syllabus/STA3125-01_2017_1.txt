In this class we will explore basic theories - such as simple linear 
regression models, multiple regression models, model diagnostics and variable 
selections. If time permitted, we will discuss Logistic and Poisson 
regressions. The course is centred around theoretical developments underlying 
the regression analyses. Students should attend class for lecture and 
important announcements. Instructor is not liable for any disadvantages 
resulting from not attendning classes.
