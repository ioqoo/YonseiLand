Over the past 150 years, food systems have been transformed by developments in technology, science, and policy. At the same time that these changes have improved the human condition, they have also created new challenges. For instance, new technologies in farming equipment and synthetic fertilizers vastly increased the per-acre output of farms, but also contributed to the collapse of rural communities and the eutryphication of water ways. This class examines how the relationship between society and food has affected and been affected by the intertwined forces of industrialization, urbanization, and globalization. We will interrogate positions that the industrial food system is `inevitable` or `indispensible` to feeding a global population of 9 billion. This class will explore how technology and policy has helped bring about societies in which high levels of obesity, food insecurity, and food waste coexist. Students will examine critical case studies (e.g. GMOs, biofuels) to learn how these challenges are understood as policy problems and how science and technology are mobilized to address these problems. 

Final Paper Project description:
Students will also have a brief introduction to conducting one-on-one interviews to prepare them for their oral histories food systems project. 
For the oral histories project, students will conduct oral history interviews with elder(s) of their choice. This could be your parents, an aunt or uncle, grandparents, a friend of the family, or an acquaintance; though you should interview someone your parents` age or older to learn about their experiences with and recollections of food systems.
