Since Aristotleâ€™s Poetics, plot has occupied a central place in the 
investigation of dramatic and narrative story structure. On this course, we 
will look at some of the major writing on plot and investigate its importance 
in the making of successful fiction and film. The course will begin with a 
reading of Aristotle, before turning to consider such important theorists of 
the plot as Gustav Freytag, Vladimir Propp and Gerard Genette. It will then 
turn to a consideration of contemporary narrative stylisticians, running from 
Roger Fowler to Michael Toolan. Representative drama will include Oedipus Rex 
and The Importance of Being Earnest; representative fiction, James Joyce and 
James Lasdun; representative films, Psycho, The Talented Mr Ripley, The 
Shining, A Clockwork Orange and Swimming Pool.
