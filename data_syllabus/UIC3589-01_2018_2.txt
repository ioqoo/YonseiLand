The aim of this course is to understand contemporary cinema through the perspective of gender studies. Students will be introduced to current interpretive concepts at the intersection of film studies and gender studies and learn to apply them to film texts. Each week there will be two types of assignment: critical essays and select films addressing the issues of gender and sexuality, which we will synthesize into fresh interpretations, critiquing both in the process. The goal of the exercise will be an outlook on contemporary discourse--from ideas to practices--in the arena of gender and sexuality.
