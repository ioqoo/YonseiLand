The Wire

This course is concerned with David Simonâ€™s influential, groundbreaking television drama The Wire (2002-2008). Encompassing an array of social and 
institutional forms in the city of Baltimore?touching police and drug dealers, politics, the press, public schools, and organized labor?the show reveals 
how a large number of overlapping social forms serve to overdetermine social reality, while differentiating how it is experienced among various racial 
and socioeconomic groups. In addition to watching all five seasons of The Wire, we will read a substantial sample of the critical discourse that has 
developed in response to it.
