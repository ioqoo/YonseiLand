In this gateway course to the Asian Studies major, we begin by examining how time and space were re-conceptualized starting in the 19th century. We look closely at the historical context, to understand how and why intellectuals across East Asia came to embrace different aspects of European history and modernity as “universal.” What ideas and technologies enabled the construction of the nation form (民族)? What were the ideas and goals that drove competing political visions? We end by reflecting on revolutions of the 20th century, the end of revolution, and life choices that students face today. Overall, the aim of the course is to introduce students to critical scholarship in Asian Studies that shed light on power/knowledge that shape how and what we see, and the way we inhabit the world.
