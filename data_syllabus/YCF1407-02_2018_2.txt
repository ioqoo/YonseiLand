This course is an integrated three-credit blended learning format designed to improve academic skills in English divided into two parts: climate change and building an ecological civilization.  Students will develop all major skill areas that are essential to successfully communicate in an academic environment.  In the classroom, learner involvement, interaction, and critical thinking are highly encouraged and promoted.  To ensure the acquisition of the core language functions, students will participate in following written and verbal instructions, a role play, games, discussions, presentations, and problem solving exercises. Students will gain confidence functioning in an academic English-speaking environment and be exposed to authentic listening and written materials such as news, lectures, and teacher-crafted lesson materials.
