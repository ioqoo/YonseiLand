This course focuses on Edmund Husserl’s (1859-1938) philosophy, also known as phenomenology, in the 20th century. We carefully discuss the basic concepts and historical significance of his phenomenology. Husserl opened up a new perspective on the human being. Now, in the 21st century, we will discuss how “useful” his perspective is in comparison to social science and psychology in, for example, marketing and management. This will probably help students to foster interdisciplinary research capability and, in the future, to make better decisions and strategies while working in marketing and international business.
