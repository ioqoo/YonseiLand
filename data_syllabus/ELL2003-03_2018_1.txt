This course is designed to build upon the rhetorical thinking and critical reading/writing skills that you developed in Writing I. Rhetoric is the study of how language persuades people. In this course, you will continue building your rhetorical skills by identifying and analyzing strategies writers use to persuade readers. You will then learn to use those persuasive strategies in your own writing. Emphasis will be placed on essay organization & development, rhetorical strategies used in argument & persuasion, as well as consideration of audience and purpose. We will begin with an intensive focus on understanding the structure of arguments. What makes a writer persuasive? How do writers use language or rhetorical contexts to enhance an argument? You will practice academic writing with emphasis on argument, research, and style. 
Assignments, discussions, and writing exercises will be conducted both in-class and online (YSCEC). You are expected to actively participate in both formats. In addition to regular in- and out-of-class reading and writing assignments, you will be required to write three major essays.

By the end of Writing II, students should demonstrate the ability to produce writing that:
1. demonstrates the ability to use the close reading method with various texts to show cogent analysis and interpretation
2. identifies a research question, develops a research strategy, identifies and evaluates sources, and uses research sources to discover and focus a thesis
3. integrates sources with each other and with one`s own analysis
4. demonstrates a strong understanding of the purposes and conventions of MLA documentation
