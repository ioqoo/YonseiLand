This is a semester-long advanced research project carried out independently 
under the guidance of a adviser. It is especially recommended to those who 
intend to go on to graduate study. Some majors, such as Comparative Literature and Culture, allow you to do 
the thesis project directly through the major, but it is also possible for
students in all majors to do it through the common curriculum, either within 
or outside your major field of study. To do so, you have to register for UIC 
4801 SENIOR THESIS: AN INDEPENDENT STUDY. If you are considering this option, 
please read carefully the course description in the student handbook. Above 
all, you should keep in mind that you will be responsible for finding an 
adviser who will be willing to work with you. The faculty member should be a 
full-time professor at Yonsei. You may choose to work with a professor from 
either the common curriculum or the major curriculum.
