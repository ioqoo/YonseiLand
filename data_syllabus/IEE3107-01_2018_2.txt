This course will explore how Korean thinkers and reformers/ activists have 
engaged religions and ideologies in the major political, social and cultural 
developments and movements during premodern Korea and beyond. Through this 
course, the students are expected to gain a deeper understanding of how 
ideologies and religious ideas have informed the major debates and collective 
activities that have made the Korean history progress. 
  One further aim of this class is to enhance the studentsâ€™ ability to write 
readable essays and paper based on their knowledge and insight acquired through 
the lectures, readings 
and discussions.
