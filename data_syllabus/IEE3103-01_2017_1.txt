Syllabus_Korean
##
This course aims to familiarize the student with modern Korean literature, 
history, culture, and society. Classes consist of lecture, historical and 
literary readings, and film. As the main objective is an understanding of 
patterns of behavior and thought, the course content will be weighted more 
toward readings in literature than in history.
