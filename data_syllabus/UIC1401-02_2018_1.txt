Memory and Trauma

To live in the aftermath of trauma is to live out of place and out of time, floating in a perpetual past within the present; it is also to live incessantly haunted by memories that refuse to stay buried. How, then, are traumatic events remembered--and represented--by individuals who lived through them and by those who come after them? When the sheer violence of an event shatters any sense of subjectivity and intelligibility, how does one re-member one-self? 

Moreover, in that the individual always already exists within the social, how are personal re-collections of trauma further complicated by the ultimate social--the nation? When the nation claims the event for its own politics, wrenching, subordinating it from the individual, how does one navigate the haunted terrain between ethical responsibility and self-erasure? How does one mourn and memorialize trauma--to speak the unspeakable?    

This course will examine the multiple ways in which trauma (arising from catastrophic and/or violent events) is remembered. We will analyze memoirs, novels, films, photographs, and memorials/museums from a variety of cultures to understand the relationship between individual/collective, memory/history, past/present, self/nation so as to address how to make sense of, re-present, and pass on a constellation of contesting stories.
