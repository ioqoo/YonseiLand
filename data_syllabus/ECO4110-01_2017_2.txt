In this class we will study how a government makes decisions and what decisions it should make. This leads us to a variety of interesting topics such as political processes, tax policies, and so on. For example, to enact a government policy, citizens must elect the party that will take charge of the government. A typical method of election is the majority voting, which begets interesting questions: when each citizen has a different preference from each other, what will be the outcome of the majority voting? Will the outcome be efficient? If not, how can we restore efficiency in electing the government? We will study these interesting topics in this class, using economic models.
