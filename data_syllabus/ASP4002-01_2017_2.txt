This course is designed to learn the capacity and the possibility of 
ethnography, as a media practice in a society. Recently, the interest in 
ethnographic practice and research has been growing rapidly in diverse areas, 
such as contemporary art, anthropology, information science, and so forth, 
which led the ethnographic pursue to the center of the innovative 
collaborations. During a semester, through both theory and studio sections, we 
throw the further questions together to make ourselves involved dynamically in 
the flow ; Why ethnography? What is the unique tradition and possibility of 
Korean society? What is the proper direction next generation should take? Main 
contents of the class will be about (1) the legacy of ‘media art’ in Korean 
society, its historical flow and uniqueness (2) common grounds 3) searching for 
the vision and relevant questions Class will be composed of three sections; 
lecture, discussion, and studio. Additionally, separate technique workshops 
will be run if necessary. Strong focus will be on the understanding the value 
of ‘publicness’ in contemporary researches and art practices, and of
