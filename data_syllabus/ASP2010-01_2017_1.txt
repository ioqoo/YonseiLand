##
In this course we will explore important and interesting issues in the study of Korean society, and will ask how those themes can help us to better understand the simultaneous processes of globalization and nation-making. In the first half of the course we will look at Korea`s global roots as a modern nation-state, and critically examine the meaning of "Koreanness" in various Korean things/culture including Korean music, dance, food, language, etc. In the second half of the course, we will focus on the question of who is Korean, and will try to think about this question by examining relavant laws and some films. We will look at issues such as the Korean diaspora and migration. In this course we willl combine historical texts, ethnographies, and anthropological aricles focused on Korea, with disscussions on current relavant topics and in-class activities. Through reading, class discussions, and writing a final paper, you will critically reflect on the particular ways in which Korea and Koreans desire, negotiate, and practice the global and the national in its modern and contemporary history.
