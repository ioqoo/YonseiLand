The “modern era” of world history is the time period when what had formerly 
been “an underdeveloped barbarian appendage of the Mediterranean”?
Europe?came to dominate the globe. The central historical question of this 
course is “how did the West become the West?” To address that question, 
we will pursue what one scholar has described as “a non-Eurocentric 
explanation of a world that has European features.” That explanation will 
focus on contingency, accident, conjuncture, focusing specifically on the 
importance of China and India, and the commodities of silver, sugar, slaves, 
cotton, and opium. Instead of concentrating on the “rise of the nation-state” 
this course takes the opposite approach by tackling the question of why 
empires, as a form of government, continued as the dominant form of political 
organization from antiquity to the twentieth century.

The course is taught in English, and all materials are in English. I also 
expect that when you are sitting in my classroom (even before class or 
discussion has started) that you are speaking English. For me, English is a way 
for people from multiple ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds to 
communicate in a shared space without social distinction. Private conversations 
in a language other than English unintentionally create barriers between 
students.
