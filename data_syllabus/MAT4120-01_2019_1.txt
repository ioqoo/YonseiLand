Riemann surfaces are, by definition, real 2-dimensional real manifolds which are equipped with a complex structure.
(Or equivalently, Riemann surfaces refer to complex 1-dimensional manifolds.)
Hence one may think of a study of Riemann surface as a slight generalization of a theory of holomorphic functions on the complex plane, 
and they turn out to share lots of similarity in local aspects.
The goal of this course is to learn various geometric features of Riemann surfaces. 
For details, see the weekly plan show below (it could vary depending on your feedback as we proceed.)
