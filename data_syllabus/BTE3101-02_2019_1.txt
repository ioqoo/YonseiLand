This course focuses on topics related to the processes and functions carried 
out during the lifetime of a cell.  Topics including the actin and microtubule 
cytoskeletons as well as molecular motor proteins and cell motility will be 
covered in detail.  We will also focus on cell-cell communication, signal 
transduction and cell signaling in the context of unicellular and 
multicellular organisms.  In addition, we will spend time discussing the cell 
cycle with an emphasis on the regulation of transitions between cell cycle 
stages.  Each process covered in class plays a role in some important aspect 
of cell physiology and we will touch on examples of defects in these systems 
that can lead to disease.  Each topic will include discussions of experimental 
strategies and laboratory techniques.
