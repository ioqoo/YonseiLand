This course provides students with an opportunity to understand human cognition and brain in various contexts.  It covers a wide range of cognition (e.g., perception, attention, memory, language) that applies to our various living contexts and the workings of the human brain relevant to the cognition.  Throughout the semester, students will learn important concepts and issues regarding human cognition and brain, and how they are influenced by, changes in, or interacts with our living contexts.  My hope is that students will become more attentive to and observant of the ways of their living and be able to translate their observations into psychological terms and concepts by the end of the semester, and ultimately convert them to social policies.
