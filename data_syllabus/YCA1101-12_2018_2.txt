His- and her-story, social development and culture are worldwide concerns 
which are all affected by Christianity. The goal of this course is to help 
students understand  the traditional development of and core message of 
Christianity, and World Christianity with its own culture, as well as to 
promote ethical awareness. There will be neither proselytizing nor 
evangelizing in this course. Being acquainted with Christianity is considered 
one essential part of becoming a global citizen and a community-serving leader.
