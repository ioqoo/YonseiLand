COURSE DESCRIPTION: 

“The best prophet of the future is the past.” Byron, 1821
History is a powerful tool; a basic understanding of the history of design and familiarity with important design styles, movements and designers is essential for thorough design related work. By examining the work of other designers, we are better able to identify our own interests and concerns. Finding objects, designers, and solutions that have resonance for us allows us a richer experience, and lets us tailor the broad field of Design to our own interests, and stay focused on what matters to us. Knowing how designers have solved problems in the past can inform today’s problem solving, leading to stronger, richer, and faster solutions. 

GOALS:
This class will offer a chronological overview of history of Modern and Contemporary Design, presented in a lecture format. Topics discussed will include major design styles and movements, significant designers, manufacturers, and design-related companies, innovations in technology and material use, and the development of sales, marketing.
Students will explore different definitions of design and identify historical, contemporary, and future boundaries of the profession. One objective of the class is to produce basic comprehension of the history of contemporary design. The larger goal, though, is to afford students access to the widest possible range of information and images, to allow personal exploration and deeper knowledge where they are interested. This will help students bring history to life in a way that is useful to them in school and beyond.
