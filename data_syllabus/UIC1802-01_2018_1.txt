From the beginnings of human civilization, music has been an important part of 
life, playing a part in religious rituals and ceremonies, festivals and daily 
life, and accompanying human beings in times of peace and times of war. But 
why is it that music has such a power over the emotions, and how can we learn 
to talk about music and analyze what it is?
The aim of this course is to provide you with the tools to become intelligent 
listeners of music. After learning to recognize and describe formal elements 
of music, such as melody, harmony, rhythm, texture, timbre, musical form we 
will study the history of Western classical music, mainly from the Barogue 
period to the Romantic period.    
Listening exercizes and class participation will constitute an important part 
of instruction.
