The course differs from other courses in Logic through its four(4) main objectives.

First, the course will be devoted to getting clear on the fundamental mathematical, philosophical issues/problems that arise out of Godelâ€™s incompleteness theorem, the first limitative theorem in modern metalogic.

Second, to show that for both Godel and Einstein,  mathematics was a window onto ultimate reality.

Third, to show how Godel`s concept of incompleteness was critically influenced by Schopenhauer.  

Fourth, to show what is Einstein Project and why Einstein now?
