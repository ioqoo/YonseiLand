The objective of this course is to study the theoretical backgrounds and 
principles in building acoustics in order to expand the understanding of indoor 
environment in architecture. Topic will include theoretical review in acoustics 
for the practical applications of indoor environmental factors. Analyses for 
the application of architectural acoustics will be discussed. Occasionally, 
theoretical calculation methods will be employed to optimize the influence of 
acoustical factors in architecture.
