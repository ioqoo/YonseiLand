Presentations
Each student will present at least one topic (one dealing with the period up to

include, but are not limited to: surveys of composer works, surveys of specific 
genres in a period, studies of performance practice appropriate to specific 
composers/styles/periods, analyses of important works, etc. Topics will be 
presented orally with appropriate musical examples (either performed live or 
recorded), and must include either an outline with detailed notes or a script, 
and a full bibliography to be turned in. The talk will be limited to 15 
carefully prepared minutes, with a three-minute question period. Students will 
be expected to practice and time their presentations to conform to these 
guidelines.

Exams: 
A take-home midterm and an in-class final will constitute 35% of your final 
grade.
