What do professional writers do? Through the course, students will read 
definitions of professional and technical writing from academic and 
professional perspectives. Building on knowledge gained in previous writing 
courses, students will read and create documents in genres that may be 
unfamiliar to them but that are fundamental parts of life in corporate, 
nonprofit, and government settings as they develop an awareness of genre. 
Using a process-oriented approach, writing assignments have been designed to 
help students gain practical skills such as how to write memos, proposals, and 
reports, which are common documents in the workplace. However, class 
discussions and readings focus on rhetoric, ethics, design and the issues and 
challenges of professional writing in a variety of workplace contexts. The 
students’ engagement with various texts will allow them to connect with 
abstract topics such as audience, persona, tone, style, ethics, purpose, 
research, and design.

During this course students will have an opportunity to:
•investigate the ways in which audience, purpose, and context shape effective 
communication
•develop the skills you will use to compose work-related writing, including 
teamwork, document design, and persuasion
•analyze professional documents and draw conclusions about what constitutes 
effective and ineffective communication
