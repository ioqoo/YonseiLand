Course Description     The goal of this course is to help students develop skills in close reading, critical analysis and persuasive writing, including grammar, punctuation, citation, and style. At the same time, students will be introduced to the topic of Airport Cities, a new 21st century urban typology of megaprojects in which a host of travel, business, and leisure facilities?such as hotels, convention centers, golf courses, theme parks, casinos, logistics and R&D centers, and in some cases whole satellite cities?are anchored to newly built or expanded airport terminal buildings, whose space, aesthetics, and program have also undergone significant changes. We will explore the rudiments of this phenomenon through the frame of critical globalization theory focusing on how it is linked to the cultures and processes of neoliberal globalization.
The class will explore such maters through careful readings of texts ranging from theory history, film and journalism, drawn from a variety of social science and humanities disciplines, with particular focus on critical theory and cultural studies. These readings combined with a series of short writing assignments and two papers will familiarize students to the mechanics of academic writing. This course will be reading and writing intensive, with the overarching objective to develop critical thinking skills and the ability to communicate clearly in writing.
