Organic Chemistry is the study of the compounds of carbon and hydrogen, their 
reactions and preparation. It is a fundamental course for the life 
sciences, materials, and chemical engineering. This class will focus on 
synthesis, reaction mechanism, and practical application of organic mateials, 
while strongly emphasizing the close relationships between the molecular 
structure and properties of organic molecules, to become quite skilled in the 
use of of organic molecules.
