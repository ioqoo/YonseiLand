This course will give students an introduction to the history of medieval Iran and the Middle East between the seventh and fifteenth centuries. 
Students will explore the role of Sasanian, Islamic and Turco-Mongolian traditions of kingship and statehood in the formation of an `Iranian` political 
identity at the start of the modern era. Some of the themes that will be explored in this course include empire, popular religion, kingship, and cultural 
identity. 
This course is intended to advance the students understanding of global processes, to improve their ability to conduct independent research, to read 
both primary sources and modern sources critically, and to develop critical thinking and reasoning skills in a historical context. Having completed this course students will be able to:
- Demonstrate an understanding of the key themes of medieval Iranian history
- Analyse and explicate major ideas associated with the history of Iran
- Use period sources to reconstruct attitudes, beliefs and arguments from the past
- Construct evidence-based arguments about the legacy of important events in Iranian history.
This course will be conducted entirely in English.
