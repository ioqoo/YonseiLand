“The Art of the Short Story” will look at key examples of the Anglo-American short story, from the beginning of the twentieth century until the present time. Work to be considered will include: James Joyce, “The Dead” (1914); F. Scott Fitzgerald, “Babylon Revisited” (1931); Mary McCarthy, “The Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt” (1943); Mavis Gallant, “The Ice Wagon Going Down the Street” (1963); Raymond Carver, “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love” (1981); James Lasdun, “An Anxious Man” (2007); Nathan Englander, “What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank” (2011); Kristen Roupenian, “Cat Person” (2017); Sadia Shepard, “Foreign-Returned” (2018). The aim of the course will be to introduce you to the short story as one of the most significant and richest of our literary forms, a form that allows for a compressed exploration of the central aspects of human nature, including sexuality, betrayal, regret, temptation, fear, and death.
